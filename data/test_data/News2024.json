Absolutely.\u201d\n\nCogburn has elevated his game to a new level and shown high speed in both 2024 starts, blasting to a clear lead from the Jaipur starting gate and establishing blistering splits (:21.33 and :43.07) while traveling comfortably. The outcome was never in doubt as he cruised to the finish line, scoring by 3 1/2 lengths as the 2.15-1 favorite.\n\n\u201cSo fast, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Ortiz, who notched his third stakes win on the Belmont S.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank ( ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nJiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank's EPS has grown 24% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. It's noted that Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 11% to CN\u00a57.9b. That's a real positive.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

For companies with market capitalisations between CN\u00a515b and CN\u00a546b, like Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank, the median CEO pay is around CN\u00a51.6m.\n\nThe Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank CEO received total compensation of only CN\u00a5150k in the year to December 2023. This total may indicate that the CEO is sacrificing take home pay for performance-based benefits, ensuring that their motivations are synonymous with strong company results. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nIs Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nFor growth investors, Jiangsu Changshu Rural Commercial Bank's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With swiftly growing earnings, the best days may still be to come, and the modest CEO pay suggests the company is careful with cash. We think that based on its merits alone, this stock is worth watching into the future.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 37% to be precise, is individual insiders. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nClearly, insiders benefitted the most after the company's market cap rose by CN\u00a5857m last week.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Jiujiang Defu Technology.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Jiujiang Defu Technology?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nJiujiang Defu Technology already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Jiujiang Defu Technology's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nJiujiang Defu Technology is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Ke Ma, with ownership of 31%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 10% and 6.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Defu Ma, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors.\n\nOn looking further, we found that 51% of the shares are owned by the top 4 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Jiujiang Defu Technology\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Jiujiang Defu Technology Co., Limited. Insiders own CN\u00a53.8b worth of shares in the CN\u00a510b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nPrivate Equity Ownership\n\nWith a stake of 10%, private equity firms could influence the Jiujiang Defu Technology board. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nWe can see that Private Companies own 9.4%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nWe can see that public companies hold 6.6% of the Jiujiang Defu Technology shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

President Joko Widodo or Jokowi said that Indonesia has great potential to process the raw materials of seaweed into ready-to-use products.\n\nActing Director General of Capture Fisheries, Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Tb. Haeru Rahayu said that compared to shrimp farming, seaweed production costs are smaller. Seaweed farmers could enjoy financial aid from various aspects, for example, through the funding agency LPMUKPLU. \"It's financially good, over a trillion a year for the entirety of the fisheries sector,\u201d he said on Sunday, May 19, 2024.\n\nTb Haeru claims that licensing for the seaweed industry is easy because physical submission is no longer necessary with the presence of OSS. The location for seaweed cultivation could also be determined by the local government. Cultivators are allowed to use up to a hectare of area for Rp18.680 million.\n\nConcerning the risk of poor-quality seeds, the Ministry claims to have used the Tissue Culture technique. The ministry also has six technical implementation units in Lombok, Jepara, Lampung, Talakar, and Situbondo, which deliver public assistance each year.\n\nCurrently, Tb said, China is the largest investor in Indonesia, followed by Korea, Japan, and India which have established the industry in Bali.\n\nTb Haeru explained that the government is targeting to reduce exports of raw seaweed from 80 percent to 50 percent.\n\nPreviously, President Joko Widodo pushed for the downstream seaweed industry in Indonesia. He believes that Indonesia has great potential as the largest seaweed-producing country in the world.

Even though Israel kept its strike small, Iran might have feared the attack against its air defense infrastructure could have been a prelude to more consequential strikes against its military or political infrastructure. If Tehran believed that such an attack was underway, it would have faced pressure to launch its own strikes before its missiles or aircraft were destroyed on the ground.\n\nThe strike minimized this fear by targeting only the shortest-range radar in Iran\u2019s air defense complex, designed not to locate threats but to guide interceptor missiles to their target. Although the system would be ineffective until a new engagement radar was installed, Iran would also have maintained relatively high confidence that the sky above Natanz was not about to be full of Israeli jets.\n\nFinally, the attack might have led to further escalation and war if Iran believed it crossed a new symbolic threshold that forced Tehran to escalate in response. But the attack avoided this escalation by replicating the visible features of previous attacks against military facilities in Iran, which were likely conducted with quadcopter drones, and by striking military rather than civilian targets. Some evidence suggests that this time Israel struck Iran with a missile launched from Syrian airspace, but Iranian leaders do not seem to believe that the attack was sufficiently different as to require a response that would risk open war. Iranian media claimed that air defenses had destroyed three drones over Isfahan and made no mention of a missile.\n\nThe level of calibration apparent in Israel\u2019s strike suggests that Israel still wants to avoid open war with Iran, matching Iran\u2019s signaling that it does not want open war with Israel. But this new status quo is hardly guaranteed to hold. For example, changes in domestic politics could make both countries more willing to risk war. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to have gained international and domestic support for his measured response, but war cabinet members Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot argued for a counterattack while Iranian drones and missiles were still in the sky over Israel on April 13. In addition, far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called on Israel to \u201cgo berserk\u201d and deliver \u201ca crushing attack\u201d in response to Iran\u2019s bombardment before suggesting that Israel\u2019s response was insufficient. While Iran\u2019s politics are more opaque, there are almost certainly hard-liners pressing for more open action against Israel.\n\nEven though both sides stepped back from the brink, the Middle East is a more dangerous place because of April\u2019s crisis. Both Israel and Iran crossed important symbolic thresholds, and both parties could be more willing to escalate to comparable attacks in the future. And there will be plenty of opportunities for them to do so. Israel appears to be gearing up for an invasion of Rafah, its conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon continues to rage, and Iranian-backed groups still conduct attacks across the region. With its airstrike, however, Israel appears to have successfully walked a tightrope between escalation and inaction.\n\nAlexander Palmer is an associate fellow with the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

It is cold in winter and hot in summer with high RH in warm seasons. This climate is very common in southern China30. Mianyang is located in the southwest of China is a typical Cfa city. With the continuous urban environment degradation, such as pollution31 and natural land shrinkage32, extreme weather conditions have frequently appeared in recent years33. The summer of Mianyang city spanned from June to Early September every year; The annual hottest month has a maximum temperature above 35.0 \u00b0C (Fig. 134). Nevertheless, recently, the summers are gradually getting warmed. The year 2022 has experienced the hottest summer of Mianyang in history (Fig. 1). Therefore, avoiding the impact of extreme weather is currently emerging as an urgent task.\n\nFigure 1 Histogram of extreme temperature values recorded in Mianyang in the latest decade in summer. Full size image\n\nMianyang is located in the north of Sichuan, China (Fig. 2), and is geographically surrounded by mountains. A big river (the Fujiang River, FJR) goes through the city. The width of the river section in the study area is 228.0 m, the maximum depth is above 26.0 m, and it flows from northwest to southeast (Fig. 3)35. The cooling effect of the water surfaces has been widely confirmed to be effective36. The cooling intensities are strongly dependent on the local physical properties37 and could be also affected by the attributes of FJR. FJR supplements the local water demands while adjusting the city climate. In the present work, the sites around the riverbank were selected as samples for field measurement. According to the literature, it has been confirmed that waterbodies and site geometry affect the thermal comfort levels. As a result, the sites located closer to the water surfaces38 and/or with lower openness39 are cooler.\n\nFigure 2 Locations of the city and the studying areas35 (processed by Adobe Photoshop40). Full size image\n\nFigure 3 Locations of the 2 sites35 (processed by Adobe Photoshop40). Full size image\n\nTherefore, points with different distances from the water surface (DFW) on the bank were selected for performing the measurements. There were a total of 16 points chosen, which were divided into two groups (Groups A & B). The test site was around 2.5 km from Mianyang Meteorological Station (Fig. 3). Group A refers to sites canopied by trees, whereas the B were mostly open. All points in each group ranged on a line being vertical to the river. They were defined as Points 1 (within 5 m of the river) to 8. The neighboring points were 10.0 m to each other.\n\nThe representative Groups A (canopied) and B (open) along the FJR were selected as samples. According to the degree of vegetation cover, the sites can be classified as open (without canopy cover) or closed (densely covered by trees)41. Their coverage was indicated by the sky view factor (SVF42). The SVF is a parameter developed by WinSCANOPY28 supporting the forestry and agriculture studies. It defines the site openness by the visibility of the sky in a hemisphere, ranging from 0 (fully covered) to 1 (totally open). The values of this factor could be acquired from the software in WinSCANOPY. The points in Group A have lower SVF than B; the lands on two lines were covered lawns.

[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nThe Biden administration's doubling of the import tax on Chinese solar cells to 50 percent on Tuesday has been opposed by some US contractors.\n\nThe increase \"will protect against China's policy-driven overcapacity that depresses prices and inhibits the development of solar capacity outside of China\", a White House fact sheet said. The administration is planning to exclude from tariffs equipment used to produce domestic solar panels.\n\nThe issue of tariffs on solar products has pitted US manufacturers that want protection from what they see as cut-rate Chinese competitors against contractors and installers who seek low-priced imported panels.\n\nJim, a house builder in Charleston, South Carolina, who asked that his full name not be used, said it was the wrong decision.\n\n\"South Carolina has the sunshine, and I need the solar panels to capture it,\" he told China Daily. \"The new tariff will mean I will pay more and so will the customer.\"\n\nHe noted that many of his customers are recent retirees who moved to the state because of a lower cost of living and he said they won't be able to afford any price increase.\n\nKeith, who said he has sold real estate in Charleston and the area for 15 years and asked that his full name not be used, told China Daily, \"It's hard enough now with interest rates to sell anything. People want solar because it will lower their electric rates. But they will choose spending more money to put in a pool over a higher cost for many solar panels.\"\n\nAbigail Ross Hopper, the president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group whose membership includes importers and installers, said the new tariff also will effectively mean another hurdle in the Biden administration's goal of transitioning the US to cleaner energy.\n\n\"This misstep will have a devastating impact on the US solar market at a time when solar prices are climbing, and project delays and cancellations are adding up,\" she said in a statement.\n\nOne of the key steps in the global solar industry supply chain \u2014 the production of polysilicon solar wafers that are processed into solar cells \u2014 takes place almost entirely in China.\n\nAlthough American companies can create raw polysilicon, and a handful of US factories produce solar modules, the industry is almost entirely dependent on China for the middle of the supply chain, according to solar industry experts. No American factory produces solar wafers or cells at scale.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed a separate set of global tariffs on the solar industry in 2018. In February, the Biden administration extended those tariffs but reduced their scope by doubling the number of solar cells that can enter the US without facing any levies, an attempt to resolve the conflicting interests of the domestic producers and domestic installers.\n\nChinese solar cells represented less than 1 percent of total US solar cell imports in the first half of 2023, according to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\n\nIn 2012, the US barred almost entirely the use of solar cells and modules made in China with prohibitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties, which rerouted US solar supply chains to Southeast Asia, said Pol Lezcano, a senior solar analyst at BloombergNEF.", "toponyms": [{"word": "Liangzhou", "start": 84, "end": 93, "lat": 37.92859, "lon": 102.64037, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Wuwei", "start": 106, "end": 111, "lat": 37.92887, "lon": 102.636, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Gansu", "start": 131, "end": 136, "lat": 37.99999, "lon": 102.00001, "type": "state"}, {"word": "China", "start": 342, "end": 347, "lat": 37.99999, "lon": 102.00001, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "China", "start": 457, "end": 462, "lat": 37.99999, "lon": 102.00001, "type": "state"}, {"word": "US", "start": 651, "end": 653, "lat": 39.7837, "lon": -100.4459, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "Charleston", "start": 837, "end": 847, "lat": 32.78843, "lon": -79.93992, "type": "city"}, {"word": "South Carolina", "start": 849, "end": 863, "lat": 33.68743, "lon": -80.43637, "type": "state"}, {"word": "South Carolina", "start": 941, "end": 955, "lat": 33.68743, "lon": -80.43637, "type": "state"}, {"word": "Charleston", "start": 1327, "end": 1337, "lat": 32.78843, "lon": -79.93992, "type": "city"}, {"word": "US", "start": 1911, "end": 1913, "lat": 39.7837, "lon": -100.4459, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "US", "start": 1986, "end": 1988, "lat": 39.7837, "lon": -100.4459, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "China", "start": 2300, "end": 2305, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "country"}, {"word": "US", "start": 2381, "end": 2383, "lat": 39.7837, "lon": -100.4459, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "China", "start": 123, "end": 128, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "country"}, {"word": "China", "start": 2462, "end": 2467, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "US", "start": 2842, "end": 2844, "lat": 39.7837, "lon": -100.4459, "type": "country"}, {"word": "US", "start": 3033, "end": 3035, "lat": 39.7837, "lon": -100.4459, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "US", "start": 3161, "end": 3163, "lat": 39.7837, "lon": -100.4459, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "China", "start": 3230, "end": 3235, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "country"}, {"word": "China", "start": 3230, "end": 3235, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "country"}]}, {"text": "Promo products suppliers and other importers must ensure these firms are not part of their supply chains, as products and materials from them are prohibited from entering the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security is adding 26 China-based cotton traders and warehouse facilities to its Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List, saying there\u2019s reasonable evidence that the firms source or sell cotton from China\u2019s Xinjiang region.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that matters to businesses in the promotional products industry and other sectors whose supply chain in any way may touch these companies.

That movement continued after the imposition of military rule, eventually leading to what has become known as the \u201cKhartoum Massacre\u201d.\n\nThe same forces that took over from al-Bashir \u2013 Sudan\u2019s military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces \u2013 are now fighting each other in a civil war that started on April 15, 2023. And many activists now believe that the June 3 killings were a sign of the devastating war that was to come.\n\nHere\u2019s all you need to know about the significance of the killings:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe killings took place on the second to last day of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Thousands of protesters had remained at the sit-in, which began in early April in front of the military headquarters in Khartoum, despite rumours that security forces were planning to disperse them.\n\nSulima Shafiq, a pro-democracy activist who campaigns against violence against women and who was at the protest, said the sit-in participants believed \u201csomething [negative] could happen\u201d but the actual events that transpired \u2013 including killings, rape and the detention of scores of individuals \u2013 were not anticipated.\n\nAt least 120 people were killed. Hundreds of others went missing.\n\n\u201cAt some point, I thought that we wouldn\u2019t make it and that we would die soon,\u201d Shafiq told Al Jazeera. \u201cI thought it was just a matter of time before we would be dead like all the others.\u201d\n\nSecurity forces initially denied attacking the sit-in after it was condemned globally. They also tried to limit any information from getting out by enforcing an internet blackout starting on June 10 as well as by restricting entry to foreign journalists.\n\nThe army authorities eventually admitted they had ordered the dispersal but said mistakes had been made.\n\nDespite the killings, protesters spearheaded another march on June 30, prompting the international community to pressure the security forces into sharing power with civilian politicians in August 2019.\n\nBut the deal was not to last, and the civilian half of the transitional government was overthrown by its military partners in October 2021.\n\nHow has the pro-democracy movement adjusted since the war began?\n\nMany of the sit-in participants are members of the resistance committees, which are neighbourhood groups that were instrumental in bringing down al-Bashir and organising sustained pro-democracy protests.\n\nWhen the war started, many members of the resistance committees set up Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs). These new committees solicited donations from Sudanese people in the diaspora and assumed the task of alleviating the catastrophic humanitarian crisis brought on by the civil war.\n\nERR activists have cooperated to open first aid clinics, ferry civilians out of unsafe areas and run countless soup kitchens to feed the hungry.\n\nIn Khartoum, where severe fighting has taken place, Abd al-Qadous told Al Jazeera that his ERR has helped administer the nearest hospital.

Eleven defendants, 106 victim accounts and 133 hearings since proceedings began. The trial held in Conakry is groundbreaking. It is of historical significance because a former president is among the defendants and it is a very lengthy trial. It will mark a turning point on the African continent and may well serve as a model for other judicial proceedings.\n\nThe closing arguments were preceded by other crucial phases in a trail that is taking place in a peculiar political context, marked by the escape of the main defendant and three other defendants on the night of Friday, 3 November 2023. The spectacular episode was short-lived; three of the fugitives were quickly apprehended and returned to prison, but a fourth remains at large. The event, however, points to the flaws in the fragile State apparatus, which does not offer the fullest guarantees for the safety of those involved in the trial, especially the victims.\n\nNotwithstanding, the 133 sessions of the trial have clearly established that killings were indeed perpetrated on 28 September 2009 and in the days that followed, and that there were victims who suffered immeasurable harm as a result. This has given victims good reason to hope that they will obtain justice.\n\nAccording to Drissa Traore, a lawyer and Secretary General of the FIDH, \"[...]the closing arguments phase is important in this trial, which has lasted several months, because it signals that the verdict is imminent; it will mark the culmination of several years of commitment, concern, expectations and, above all, hope\".\n\nSouleymane Bah, President of the OGDH, declared that, \"The closing arguments are an opportunity for us to express once again our deep empathy for the victims and their families at this moment of truth, which is crucial for justice, truth, and above all, for the healing of the very deep wounds inflicted on Guinean society\".\n\n\"We must insist yet again on the need to hold the perpetrators of these atrocities to account through [a] fair and transparent justice [system], regardless of their status or political position,\" said Asmaou Diallo, President of AVIPA.\n\nBackground\n\nOn 28 September 2009, in response to a call to organise a rally from the Forces Vives, approximately 50,000 people gathered at the 28 September stadium in Conakry to demonstrate against the likely candidacy of Moussa Dadis Camara.

I spent five days photographing the protests at Columbia University, in the eight days between the first wave of arrests there and the next.\n\nI am proud of the students for leading us in confronting our participation in this war. At the same time, it saddens me that the culture of surveillance has frightened us, frightened those who stand up to be heard yet are afraid to be seen. As someone who sees for a living, I would make visible all who stood up, particularly those who stood up for peace and against violence. It is a terrible paradox. Those who could not participate in the publication of their images today have acknowledged to me how much they have to lose: there have been firings, suspensions, expulsions, even death threats. Yet they allowed me to photograph them and trusted me. For now their images have to remain private, but they will be seen another day.\n\nIt also troubles me that the protest I photographed is not the protest I see reported by most of the mainstream media. I saw no embrace of antisemitism. On the contrary, the number of Jewish protesters was impossible to ignore, as was the level of cooperation between Jews and Muslims. The image of the thing, even in this moment of media saturation, retains its power. The photograph\u2014the record of this protest against the killings\u2014is difficult to erase from the mind. It speaks to our hunger to know the world.\n\nAccra Shepp Abbi, 2024\n\nAbbi: I came to the encampment in solidarity with Columbia students, faculty, and workers who are calling on their institutions to divest from Israeli apartheid and the genocide in Gaza.

Recognizing climate change will affect extreme heat events among many other weather events, Chicago decided to conduct a vulnerability assessment to better understand the threat. Chicago conducted a vulnerability assessment that projected future expected temperatures and estimated the magnitude of threat to future heat related mortality. In anticipation of these future threats, Chicago adopted a comprehensive Climate Change Action Plan. The city\u2019s first priority under the Chicago Climate Action Plan: Adaptation Strategy Report is to adapt to extreme heat events.\n\nChicago\u2019s approach assessed vulnerability to extreme heat and promoted resiliency and adaptation actions to reduce climate risk. Specifically, Chicago is promoting resiliency through emergency response procedures, specifically including it as a specific criterion within the county's (Cook County) Hazard Mitigation Plan and identifying that its Extreme Weather Operations Plans have scalability to deal with projected changes.\n\nIn order to adapt to future extreme heat events, Chicago is identifying urban heat areas ('heat islands') of concern and then adopting heat island reduction strategies through a variety of municipal programs including: building codes and green infrastructure projects. These green infrastructure strategies provide Chicago with mutual benefits including increasing extreme heat emergency preparedness and improving stormwater management for extreme precipitation events.\n\nHow did they do it? Applicable EPA Tools Conducted vulnerability assessment of future risk from climate exacerbated extreme heat events Chicago's Climate Action Plan Impacts Report projected the future climate under varying emissions scenarios to identify expected future temperatures, note this analysis projected that by 2050, Chicago could be seeing extreme heat events equivalent to the 1995 heat wave up to twice per decade.\n\nChicago developed an algorithm which analyzed past and future climate changes and residents' ability to acclimate to anticipated future changes. This analysis allowed for an estimation of future risk for heat-related mortality.\n\nChicago simulated an extreme heat event, using data from the 2003 European heat wave, to better understand the impact on the city. Use CDC\u2019s Assessing Health Vulnerability to Climate Change to identify the communities most at risk and adopt adaptation strategies that target extreme heat vulnerabilities. Assessing Health Vulnerability to Climate Change (PDF)(24 pp, 4.3 MB) * (This is a non-EPA resource from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Chicago Targeted Efforts to Reduce the Urban Heat Island Chicago identified urban heat island \u201chot spots\u201d to target with heat reduction strategies such as green infrastructure, reflective roofing, and rooftop gardens.\n\nThe city required new flat roofs meet EPA Energy Star Cool Roof Standards, supported commercial green roofs with a Tax Increment Financed Improvement Fund, and promoted reflective roofing.\n\nThe city provided incentives for the adoption of green infrastructure through an expedited \u201dGreen Permit Process\u201d and provided grants for small projects. EPA\u2019s Urban Heat Island Strategies and EPA Energy Star Cool Roof Standards can be targeted to reduce the urban heat island and adapt to future conditions. Urban Heat Island Strategies EPA Energy Star Cool Roof Standards Promoted Adaptation Actions that Would Provide Co-Benefits Chicago incorporated heat island reduction strategies - such as green or cool roofs, cool pavements, or increased vegetation and trees - into long-term planning efforts to help lower urban temperatures as well as provide substantive benefits for other programs, including stormwater management.

The sessions in Bonn are a vital mid-year checkpoint and a precursor to COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.\n\nDiscussions in Bonn, hosted at the UNFCCC headquarters, will prepare for the critical negotiations that will unfold in Baku and subsequently in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, at COP30.\n\nAlthough this year\u2019s COP29 is projected to be smaller in scale than past years due to spatial and financial constraints, it will be no less consequential: Participating countries must come together to finalize a critical agreement: the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance. This new finance goal is anticipated to significantly shape how countries can realistically implement their new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)\u2013each country\u2019s national climate commitments\u2014due in 2025.\n\nGiven the major milestones lined up for COP29 and COP30, the June sessions in Bonn need to set the tone for heightened ambition and climate progress, especially on the complexities of climate finance, policy coherence, and equity.\n\nHere are our top themes to watch during Bonn, and how EDF is working to support a positive outcome:\n\nSetting a New Climate Finance Goal\n\nThe NCQG will be essential for enabling effective climate action globally, with a strong focus on supporting the needs and priorities of developing countries. As negotiations unfold, the objective is clear: to promote ambitious and achievable financial commitments that will help scale climate action and provide a clear trajectory toward the 2025 NDCs and beyond.\n\nBy establishing this new finance goal, the international community seeks to ensure that every country has the necessary support to implement effective climate solutions, thereby fostering a more equitable global approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nEDF is actively participating in the dialogues around the new goal, and submitted suggestions calling for ambitious, quality financial commitments and a transparent process to support effective implementation of the goal.\n\nEnsuring Equity in Climate Action\n\nA significant focus will also be on the Just Transition Work Programme, which aims to embed the principles of a just transition into global climate policy frameworks. It\u2019s about ensuring that the shift towards a low-carbon future is equitable, supporting sustainable development that benefits all sectors of society without leaving anyone behind.\n\nEDF recently published our Just Transition and Safeguards Framework , which offers a roadmap for countries and companies alike to successfully navigate the complexities of transitioning to clean energy while ensuring fairness and equity at every step of the way. We\u2019ll be working to socialize the EDF framework\u2019s guidance as countries engaged in the Just Transition Work Programme continue their deliberations.\n\nAccelerating Action on Food & Agriculture\n\nFood was on the table at COP28, as the conference opened with a declaration on sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, and climate action endorsed by 159 countries. Negotiations will resume with renewed momentum in Bonn. The goal is to accelerate action on climate resilient practices that ensure food security and address environmental impacts effectively by 2025, and to review and enhance country commitments, including through enhancing NDCs, developing specific investment pipelines, and unlocking various forms of finance.\n\nEDF is engaging with stakeholders and partners aiming to accelerate both climate mitigation and adaptation in the global food and agriculture sector through finance. This includes supporting farmers\u2019 livelihoods, climate-resilient food systems, and environmental protection.\n\nMaking Progress on Article 6: Advancing Cooperative Implementation\n\nWhile there was a lack of progress on Article 6 forms and reporting procedures at COP28, implementation of the mechanism is proceeding at the national level. This year, we\u2019ve already seen the first notifications of transactions under article 6.2 continue to deliver high-integrity climate action. Since COP28, countries aiming to work together on climate action through carbon markets have signed 13 new bilateral agreements.\n\nEfforts to operationalize Article 6.4 will focus on key decisions left over from COP28, particularly on the development of methodological guidance and on the crediting of removals under this mechanism. The Article 6.4 Supervisory Board has made progress since COP28 on other significant issues, such as the consideration of sustainable development benefits and the establishment of a grievances and appeals procedure, heralding potential renewed willingness to reach solutions from different negotiating partners.\n\nEstablishing robust international market and non-market cooperative approaches will be essential for funding and facilitating global climate action, aiming to overcome previous impasses and enhance economic sustainability.\n\nWhile EDF will be monitoring Article 6 developments closely, our active engagement will be shaped by the progress and direction of these discussions. We aim to ensure Article 6 can serve as a high-integrity tool to deliver an efficient flow of financial capital from the Global North to the Global South to meet their Paris Agreement goals. Read more about our Article 6 perspective here.\n\nTreating Our Oceans as Critical Allies in Climate Mitigation\n\nDiscussions in Bonn will also cover marine biodiversity conservation, coastal resilience, and innovative financing for ocean-based climate solutions, recognizing the integral role of oceans in the broader climate regulation framework.\n\nEDF plans to participate in the oceans and climate change process, building on our involvement in the climate action outcomes related to oceans at COP28. We worked in partnership with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to announce the Aquatic Food Breakthrough for 2030: a goal to provide at least US$ 4 billion per year to support resilient aquatic food systems that will contribute to healthy, regenerative ecosystems and sustain the food and nutrition security for three billion people.\n\nStrengthening Partnerships with all Actors\n\nParticipating countries are not the only ones responsible for climate action: progress depends on cooperation with all non-state actors. That is the ethos of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action (MP-GCA), a platform for coordinated climate action between governments and non-state actors like companies, communities, Indigenous Peoples, faith communities, and more. In the MP-GCA, High-Level Champions (HLCs) lead efforts to turn ideas into action and foster collaboration on projects that can seriously reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make the world more resilient to climate change impacts.\n\nAt EDF, we share this \u201ceveryone in\u201d mentality: we believe in activating everyone on climate, from businesses to communities to governments. In Bonn, EDF will focus on our work with the High-Level Champions (HLCs) and the sectoral leads of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action (MP-GCA). By collaborating with other non-state actors and the private sector, EDF aims to drive collective progress and amplify our impact on global climate initiatives.\n\nThe Road to COP30: Making it to Belem, Brazil\n\nAs we move from these Bonn climate talks to COP29 in Baku and onward to COP30 in Brazil, the discussions set the stage for crucial global climate action. These negotiations, enriched by Brazil\u2019s focus on nature and forests, are pivotal as they coincide with significant global environmental conventions, including the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with its own COP happening in October in Colombia. Each conference is an opportunity to forge policies that harness natural ecosystems for climate mitigation and adaptation.\n\nDuring Bonn, EDF will be engaged in discussions on forest conservation efforts through the Jurisdictional REDD+ Technical Assistance Partnership (JTAP), an initiative to support jurisdictions and local partners to participate in high-integrity voluntary carbon markets to catalyze tropical forest conservation and finance at scale.\n\nA successful outcome at COP depends on incremental collective progress throughout the year. Bonn is a critical moment to connect the dots between the upcoming moments for global climate engagement. Whether discussions focus on biodiversity, desertification, finance or just transition, weaving together the common threads and finding the synergies between them is key to taking actions that solve for multiple problems and benefit climate, communities, and ecosystems all at once.", "toponyms": [{"word": "Bonn", "start": 166, "end": 170, "lat": 50.73584, "lon": 7.10064, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Germany", "start": 172, "end": 179, "lat": 51.145, "lon": 10.448, "type": "country"}, {"word": "Bonn", "start": 343, "end": 347, "lat": 50.73584, "lon": 7.10064, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Baku", "start": 408, "end": 412, "lat": 40.3755, "lon": 49.8328, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Azerbaijan", "start": 414, "end": 424, "lat": 40.39362, "lon": 47.78726, "type": "country"}, {"word": "Bonn", "start": 442, "end": 446, "lat": 50.73584, "lon": 7.10064, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Baku", "start": 546, "end": 550, "lat": 40.3755, "lon": 49.8328, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Bel\u00e9m", "start": 571, "end": 576, "lat": -1.4506, "lon": -48.4682, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Brazil", "start": 578, "end": 584, "lat": -10.3338, "lon": 53.1958, "type": "country"}, {"word": "Bonn", "start": 1182, "end": 1186, "lat": 50.73584, "lon": 7.10064, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Bonn", "start": 1376, "end": 1380, "lat": 50.73584, "lon": 7.10064, "type": "city"}]}, {"text": "HONG KONG \u2014 Five years ago, on June 9, 2019, I watched 1 million people march through the streets of Hong Kong. Some put the crowd count higher. Police \u2014 as they do everywhere \u2014 put it lower. But it was a sea of humanity, stretching as far as I could see from my perch on one of the city\u2019s ubiquitous elevated walkways. It was the largest protest in Hong Kong\u2019s history, and by far the largest I\u2019d ever seen anywhere.\n\nIt was also almost entirely peaceful, even festive, representing a cross section of Hong Kong society. I saw students and elders, well-known activists and ordinary people, and couples pushing children in strollers. It turned ugly only briefly, at midnight, when police fired pepper spray at a few hundred stragglers who refused to disperse.\n\nThe crowd had gathered that sweltering day with a singular demand \u2014 that Hong Kong\u2019s handpicked leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, withdraw an ill-conceived extradition bill that would allow criminal suspects to be sent across the border to mainland China for trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back, it seems odd that a technical amendment to an existing ordinance would engender such widespread public attention and antipathy. Lam insisted the extradition bill was merely closing a \u201clegal loophole.\u201d Hong Kong already had extradition treaties with more than a dozen countries. China had inadvertently been left out.\n\nThat was untrue. China was deliberately left off the list at the time of the special administrative region\u2019s 1997 handover of sovereignty from British to Chinese rule. Hong Kong enjoyed a Common Law system and proudly upheld internationally accepted judicial standards and human rights. China\u2019s legal system was, and still is, a black box. Criminal suspects in China are subject to arbitrary detention, torture, forced confessions and a denial of medical treatment. China boasts a 99 percent conviction rate for suspects, sometimes after trials held in secret.\n\nHong Kongers are smart. They understood clearly that Lam\u2019s extradition bill would tear down the legal wall that separated semiautonomous Hong Kong from the Communist-controlled mainland. They turned out in unprecedented numbers to show their anger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNormally, seeing 1 million people in the streets would give any elected leader pause. But Hong Kong in 2019 wasn\u2019t a normal place, and Lam was not an elected leader. She was a career bureaucrat with no political experience, appointed by mainland China and ratified in the position by a small committee of pro-China loyalists. The vast majority of Hong Kongers had no say.\n\nLam\u2019s response to the million-person march was something like imperial disdain. She said the people \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d the bill. She said the government only needed to communicate better. And in her most condescending remark, she compared the demonstrators marching in the streets to her children throwing tantrums to get what they wanted. She vowed to ram the hated extradition bill through the pro-Beijing legislative council three days later, on June 12, 2019.\n\nThat never happened. Angry protesters surrounded the legislative building, blocking streets and charging police barricades. Police responded ferociously with tear gas and, for the first time in my memory, rubber bullets. The council members were unable to reach the chambers and the vote was postponed. A few days later, Lam reluctantly suspended the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "toponyms": [{"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 101, "end": 110, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 350, "end": 359, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 503, "end": 512, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 834, "end": 843, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "China", "start": 1012, "end": 1017, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "country"}, {"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 1260, "end": 1269, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "China", "start": 1337, "end": 1342, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "China", "start": 1394, "end": 1399, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 1545, "end": 1554, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "China", "start": 1664, "end": 1669, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "China", "start": 1738, "end": 1743, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "country"}, {"word": "China", "start": 1843, "end": 1848, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 2076, "end": 2085, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "Hong Kong", "start": 2294, "end": 2303, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "city"}, {"word": "China", "start": 2450, "end": 2455, "lat": 35.0001, "lon": 104.9999, "type": "geopolitical entity"}, {"word": "HONG KONG", "start": 0, "end": 9, "lat": 22.27933, "lon": 114.16281, "type": "geopolitical entity"}]}, {"text": "Iranian protest rap music artists Daniel Moghadam and Vafa Ahmadpour, known as Vafadar, were detained in Shiraz following the release of a music video titled \u201cBe Prepared.\u201d\n\nAccording to a post on Vafadar's Instagram page Thursday, he and Moghadam were apprehended at 1:30 p.m. in Shiraz.

One may reasonably ask what court appearances there can be for someone who has already been sentenced to 25 years in prison. But it appears the Russian state is not done with me yet.\n\nEvery month, I get a visit from a couple of polite officials from Roskomnadzor, the Russian government\u2019s censorship agency, who present me with administrative court summons for violating Russia\u2019s \u201cforeign agent\u201d law.

(This includes my great-grandfather and great-great-uncle, who were executed as \u201cLatvian agents.\u201d Both were fully rehabilitated and posthumously exonerated of all charges.) In the post-Stalin era, Soviet state propaganda went to great lengths to paint dissidents \u2014 including such notable figures as Andrei Sakharov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn \u2014 as Western stooges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Putin signed a new law that dispensed with the funding formality altogether: The Justice Ministry could now place the \u201cforeign agent\u201d label on anyone it deemed to be \u201cunder foreign influence\u201d \u2014 meaning, in practice, on any public figure who spoke out against the Kremlin. I was designated a \u201cforeign agent\u201d in April 2022 (simultaneously with my arrest) for opposing the war in Ukraine and for calling Putin a war criminal \u2014 this was the official justification produced by the Justice Ministry when I challenged the designation in court. The Russian government\u2019s \u201cforeign agent registry\u201d now includes more than 800 organizations and individuals \u2014 including Russia\u2019s most accomplished living novelists, Ludmila Ulitskaya and Boris Akunin; legendary rock musicians Andrei Makarevich and Boris Grebenshikov; renowned poet and literary critic Dmitry Bykov; and Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov.\n\nFrankly, it reads more like an honor roll than any kind of blacklist.

Another 17 civilians were injured in the strikes: 11 children, two women and four men. All are from the marginalized Gorgaarte clan.\n\nThe strikes hit the Jaffey farm, about three kilometres west of Bagdad village in the Lower Shabelle region, between 8pm and 8.30pm. Victims and other residents told Amnesty International that the drone strikes followed heavy ground fighting that started earlier that day between the armed group Al-Shabaab and Somali security forces close to the villages of Jambaluul and Bagdad.\n\nThe Somali and Turkish governments must investigate these deadly strikes as a war crime Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International\u2019s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa\n\n\u201cThe Somali and Turkish governments must investigate these deadly strikes as a war crime, and put an end to reckless attacks on civilians,\u201d said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International\u2019s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa.\n\n\u201cIn Somalia, civilians have borne the brunt of suffering in war far too often.

Both are manufactured by T\u00fcrkiye.

An initial drone strike hit a mosque in the eastern side of Bagdad at around 7.30pm, destroying the building and damaging nearby houses. Amnesty International was not able to independently verify who was targeted in the mosque, or if there were any casualties.\n\nFollowing that attack, eyewitnesses said many civilians fled to the Jaffey farm to seek refuge. The first strike on the farm killed and injured several civilians. A second attack, approximately 30 minutes later, killed and injured more civilians who had arrived from the neighbouring villages of Alifow and Gaalgube to rescue survivors following the first strike.\n\nOn 19 March, Somalia\u2019s Ministry of Information issued a statement saying that they had killed over 30 Al-Shabaab militants in the villages of Bagdad and Baldooska in coordination with \u201cinternational partners\u201d. The statement added: \u201cThe operation was launched in response to intelligence reports indicating that Al-Shabaab fighters were gathering in these areas and planning an assault against the Somali people\u2026 15 Al-Shabaab members were killed in an airstrike in Bagdad.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether Turkish or Somali forces were in control of the TB-2 drone at the time of the strikes on Jaffey farm. One source in the Somali government told Amnesty International that members of the National Intelligence and Security Agency fly the TB-2s during combat operations against Al-Shabaab.

She apologized again after Tuesday's verdict.\n\n\u201cI am surprised. I have apologized many times. Actually, I know that I was wrong, but I did not expect the sentence to be two years,\u201d Lutfiawati said after the trial.\n\nIndonesia is the largest Muslim-majority country in the world and consuming pork is considered \u201charam,\u201d or forbidden in Islam.\n\nThe charge of inciting hatred against a religious group is a part of blasphemy laws that critics in Indonesia say have been used to curtail freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been happening to Lina is not surprising, despite the government\u2019s promises\" to protect freedom of expression, said Usman Hamid, the Executive Director of Amnesty International Indonesia.
