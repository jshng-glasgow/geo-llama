By Vickie Welborn vwelborn@gannett.com Gannett March 24, 2009 MANSFIELD -- Mansfield Mayor Curtis McCoy wants to start a pastor on patrol program for the Mansfield Police Department and he's selected as his first candidate a self-described minister with a controversial past that includes time spent on the other side of the jail bars and troubles with the court system. The Rev. Roy Jones' most recent job was a convenience store clerk for which he had to obtain an alcoholic beverage control card so that he could sell alcoholic beverages. \"This is something I'm trying to do to make a better relationship between the police and the citizens,\" McCoy said of Jones' appointment. Unlike a similar program run by the Shreveport Police Department where ministers volunteer their time to ride on patrol with officers, Mansfield's Pastor on Patrol won't depend upon volunteers - or at this point anyone beyond Jones. Jones will be paid $9 an hour and work 24 hours a week. Asked why he didn't use Shreveport's program as a model, McCoy answered, \"I don't know what Shreveport does nor do I care to know what Shreveport does on that line. I only know what Mansfield is doing. \"McCoy would not comment on Jones' checkered past or his ability to remain unbiased in situations involving the police and citizenry since he is on the city's payroll. \"Based on his relationship in the community as far as knowing people, every time I go to church, I see him in a pulpit - I'm serious. I'm talking the honest God truth. & If he's not pastoring, he's there as a guest. But he knows the people in the community, and I think over the years he has proven himself to be an asset. \"Part-time employees can work six months before being presented to the Board of Aldermen. That's why Jones' official appointment was news to two Mansfield aldermen. Mitch Lewis and G.B. \"Sonny\" Hall were unaware of Jones' addition to the payroll. Lewis admitted that he was questioned over the weekend about Jones being seen last week in a patrol car with a police officer. \"I talked to Roy today (at the council meeting),\" Lewis said Monday night. \"He said yes he was doing it, but he didn't go into it. He said he was pastor on patrol. He said he was trying to get involved with the youth on the weekend and stuff like, which I think is good, but & I don't know. I think (McCoy's) intentions were good to try to set up that type of program. \"Added Hall: \"Most true pastors volunteer their time to do that. \"Jones, who was unseated in October 2007 from his first term on the DeSoto Parish Police Jury, is a close friend of McCoy's. He's aided the mayor in his two election campaigns and frequently accompanies him to functions. Jones did not return a message left on his answering machine Monday. Jones grabbed his own headlines while on the parish governing body. He was consistently involved in employee issues and public criticism of the road department supervisor, including filing complaints with the state attorney general's office that were later deemed unfounded. The Mansfield resident got his own hand slapped in 2005 when the district attorney ordered him to reimburse the parish $175 for gravel he directed onto a private driveway. He has prior arrests for trespassing, issuing worthless checks, failure to appear in court for criminal neglect of family and for failing to report to court on issuing worthless check charges. While he spent time in the DeSoto Detention Center for his arrests, Jones has avoided jail sentences by paying off the insufficient funds and the late child support payments. McCoy said he would later evaluate the program and add a \"white minister, too, because we want everyone to have someone they can talk to.\" Jones is black.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}, {"name": "MANSFIELD", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}, {"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}, {"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}, {"name": "Shreveport", "latitude": 32.5252, "longitude": -93.7502}, {"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}, {"name": "Shreveport", "latitude": 32.5252, "longitude": -93.7502}, {"name": "Shreveport", "latitude": 32.5252, "longitude": -93.7502}, {"name": "Shreveport", "latitude": 32.5252, "longitude": -93.7502}, {"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}, {"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}, {"name": "DeSoto Parish", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 32.0377, "longitude": -93.7002}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The Thursday announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said a \"lion's share\" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in the next week to 10 days, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders \"are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of Minnesota with massive tax increases.\" Brian McClung added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. \"An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts,\" McClung said. \"We would expect more from DFL legislators.\" Tom Dooher, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with the Senate announcement. \"The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesota\u00e2 s school children,\" Dooher said. \"If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students.\" House leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. House and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and Pogemiller has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. Bakk said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. Bakk also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, Bakk said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal. Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers, supporting Pawlenty's proposed business tax cuts instead. Pogemiller said drastic measures such as the 7 percent cut are needed because of the current recession. Most of the cuts, he added, will be to programs most affecting the state's needy residents. He called the economy \"as bad, potentially, as the 1930s.\" The Minnesota House unanimously voted to support freedom of the press Thursday, after a week of controversy. House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall \u00e2 \u201c joined by House Majority Leader Tony Sertich, DFL-Chisholm \u00e2 \u201c brought a motion to the floor voicing that support because proposed House rules would have restricted media work on the House floor and in committees. The proposed rules emerged a week ago today, creating a stir among the Capitol press corps. Then, Monday night, a committee page demanded to see credentials from a photographer \u00e2 \u201c two hours after a House leadership spokesman assured the media that no credentials would be needed to cover committee meetings. Seifert said recent events had \"a chilling effect\" on the press. \"I am very concerned about what has taken place recently.\" Sertich said the proposed rules will not be implemented. He said there has been confusion as the rules were being discussed and no changes should have been made by House staff members. Rep. Torrey Westrom, R-Elbow Lake, said the talk of stricter press rules is a sign of bigger problems with DFL leaders. \"I know the press isn't really happy with some of the moves going on around here,\" Westrom said. \"I'm glad they are speaking up.\" Numerous House members have told reporters that they also were not happy with the proposals.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Cook", "latitude": 47.8524, "longitude": -92.6896}, {"name": "Minneapolis", "latitude": 44.98, "longitude": -93.2638}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "Marshall", "latitude": 44.4469, "longitude": -95.7884}, {"name": "Chisholm", "latitude": 47.4891, "longitude": -92.8838}, {"name": "Elbow Lake", "latitude": 45.9941, "longitude": -95.9767}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Groth, whose home flooded in 1997 when the Red River crested at 39.57 feet, said she didn\u00e2 t think a repeat was possible. \u00e2 I never thought it could happen again. We\u00e2 re nervous,\u00e2 she said. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty stopped in Oakport and Moorhead, urging state residents to join the flood fight. About 230 Minnesota National Guard troops were helping with flood efforts, and he said he expects that number will eventually reach about 400. Hoeven said the state\u00e2 s National Guard committed 500 soldiers to the water war, with more available. Fargo raised its goal for daily sandbag output to 300,000 to try to fill 2 million bags by Thursday. \u00e2 If those neighborhoods hold, we are safe as a city,\u00e2 said Fargo City Commissioner Tim Mahoney. \u00e2 If we\u00e2 re unable to do that, we\u00e2 re going to have a problem. \u00e2 The city was prepared for a Red River crest of 38 feet. Now, city officials want to get the dikes up to 42 feet, Mahoney said. At 41 feet \u00e2 we lose a lot of houses,\u00e2 he said. \u00e2 If we\u00e2 re going to get this thing done, it\u00e2 s going to have to be done in the next 24 to 48 hours in a massive way. \u00e2 The Fargodome, where volunteers waited for bus rides to Sandbag Central, the city\u00e2 s utilities building, became its own sandbag-filling station with hundreds of shovel-wielding volunteers scooping sand dumped on the parking lot. Sandbaggers kept spirits up despite the gloomy weather and flood outlook. Fargo plans to give residents routes out of town Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, said Pat Zavoral, Fargo city administrator. \u00e2 There are some locations in south Fargo where if the water does break away from these [dikes], they won\u00e2 t be able to use Interstate-29,\u00e2 he said. Fargo Police Chief Keith Ternes urged residents to go to the city\u00e2 s Web site and register for the Code Red alert system so they can be reached in an emergency. Residents with land lines are already registered in the system. Sandbagging efforts continued overnight. City officials hope they get 300 people an hour to help fill sandbags at the city\u00e2 s utility operation center at 2301 8th Ave. N. and 1,000 people an hour at the Fargodome. Hoeven asked for a presidential emergency declaration based on preparation efforts because of the costs. He said he thinks the state might get it today.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 45.8852, "longitude": -95.3775}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 45.8852, "longitude": -95.3775}, {"name": "Red River", "latitude": 46.6488, "longitude": -92.2363}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Moorhead", "latitude": 46.8739, "longitude": -96.7676}, {"name": "Red River", "latitude": 46.6488, "longitude": -92.2363}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Red River Valley", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Nebraska", "latitude": 41.5003, "longitude": -99.7507}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Afghanistan", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 65.0}, {"name": "40th Avenue South", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "North Dakota", "latitude": 47.5003, "longitude": -100.001}, {"name": "Oakport Township", "latitude": 46.9416, "longitude": -96.7256}, {"name": "Moorhead", "latitude": 46.8739, "longitude": -96.7676}, {"name": "Red River", "latitude": 46.6488, "longitude": -92.2363}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "Oakport", "latitude": 46.9319, "longitude": -96.779}, {"name": "Moorhead", "latitude": 46.8739, "longitude": -96.7676}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Red River", "latitude": 46.6488, "longitude": -92.2363}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}, {"name": "Fargo", "latitude": 46.8772, "longitude": -96.7898}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

He noted this is a seasonal issue that happens almost every year. In addition, water has caused a portion of County Road 56 to wash out. This road is located west of County Road 15, southwest of Brandon. Lastly, a culvert on County Road 96 is washed out, closing a portion of the road, which is located northeast of Kensington by Freeborn Lake. \u00e2 Right now, these are the only three [county] roads that are closed,\u00e2 said Robley. He asked that motorists use caution when driving around the county and if there is water flowing over the road, motorists should not drive on it. If there is standing water, he said proceed with caution. With Tuesday\u00e2 s storm dumping even more snow on the area, Robley said public works will keep a close eye on area roads, but he said that depending on the conditions, he wasn\u00e2 t too concerned.

He noted the utility work for the project should start in April and the actual roadwork should begin shortly after that. He also mentioned there are plenty of other roads around the county with potholes or other problems that the public works department is working on, which he said is a normal occurrence this time of year. Robley added the roads may seem to be in worse shape this year because of the colder than normal temperatures. He reiterated that the amount of snow doesn\u00e2 t make as big of an impact as the cold temperatures. A wet fall helped drive the frost deeper, which wreaks havoc on roads.

When Alexandria police found the body of Juantissa Hill, 24, inside her Van Dorn Street apartment early last December, she had not shown up for work in two days. Her family, friends and coworkers waited for her missing Nissan Altima to turn up, hoping that it would lead police to the person who raped and killed the young Navy petty officer who worked at the Pentagon. Hill\u2019s car was eventually found without a suspect inside, giving investigators only leads. On Monday, about three months later, an Alexandria grand jury indicted 31-year-old Rodney Eric Smith on charges of first-degree murder, forcible sodomy, robbery and grand larceny. As with the majority of rape and assault cases, Smith and Hill knew each other, according to Deputy Chief Blaine Corle, commander of police investigations. \u201cThis was not a stranger case,\u201d Corle said. \u201cWe do know that they had some prior contact. We don\u2019t have any reason to think that this was a case in which there was any danger to the public of a random assault.\u201d Smith was arrested and convicted of \u201ca relatively minor charge\u201d in another state, according to Alexandria Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Randy Sengel, who will head Smith\u2019s prosecution. Sengel would not identify the jurisdiction but said Smith was sentenced there and is currently incarcerated while awaiting a transfer to Virginia, where he will stand trial. Smith is also wanted in a third state for failure to appear in court in relation to other charges but will likely be sent to Virginia next under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. \u201cThere is also another jurisdiction that has a warrant for him but we\u2019ve been in touch with them and we\u2019re going to try to coordinate [his transfer to Virginia],\u201d Sengel said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our case is by far the most serious of the cases and they won\u2019t have any problem with us going ahead [with a trial].\u201d Alexandria detectives worked with Naval Criminal Investigative Services in searching for Hill\u2019s rapist and killer, utilizing military resources to investigate Hill\u2019s background \u2014 her characteristics and associations \u2014 in hopes it would lead them to a suspect. \u201cAny time you work a homicide investigation, getting to know a lot about your victim is often equal to where the case leads you,\u201d Corle said. \u201cAnd NCIS was very cooperative in helping us find out about Ms. Hill and \u2026 her background \u2014 who she associated with and things like that. All the things you just have to start digging from scratch on.\u201d The leads police obtained in the case originated in Alexandria and the surrounding area, according to Corle. Police also received help from the public but \u201cthis just happens to be one of the cases where \u2026 the lion\u2019s share of the success came from the work of the detectives in Alexandria,\u201d Corle said. Police did not say exactly how they connected Smith with the homicide but Alexandria Police Spokeswoman Ashley Hildebrandt said the nature of his arrest and conviction in another state was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the type of crime inflicted on Hill. Sengel would not comment on whether it was related to sexual assault. Sengel estimated that Smith\u2019s transfer to Virginia would take 60 to 90 days citing the suspect\u2019s recent sentencing in the other jurisdiction and the copious amounts of paperwork necessary for an interstate transfer. Once here, he would go directly to trial in Alexandria\u2019s Circuit Court, but given the circumstances and nature of the case, Sengel estimated that it could be a minimum of 90 days after he is transferred until Smith stands trial.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Van Dorn Street", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Morris stressed the importance of coordinating the relationships inside and outside of school and that the school system needs to be willing to meet the community part of the way. \u201cEducation needs to be a partnership between parents, teachers and the children themselves, and if there is, and there\u2019s a good roadmap, then our children will succeed,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt involves rigorous academics, community involvement in education and it involves character education.\u201d Carter keyed in on accountability within ACPS and the need for a solid foundation from which to go about improving achievement among minorities and English language learners. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a system set up for our teachers to engage with our parents, the best communication system in the world will not work,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe really need to figure out how to set up these very basic things like translation services, bilingual staffing in the schools, start there and then set up a more systemized approach to engage parents.\u201d Newsham, an incumbent, reiterated what he would continue to do as a school board representative, setting policy and obtaining the necessary resources for students to be successful, something that starts with the pending strategic plan and continues with high expectations in a rigorous curriculum. \u201cI think the best way to close the achievement gap is to implement the strategic plan that the board has spent the last six to nine months developing,\u201d Newsham said. \u201cWithin the school system over the last three years we have come to realize that there is an achievement gap, that it is a serious situation and that we have the means to address it.\u201d As the other incumbent in District A, Gorsuch said that the board needs \u201cto really analyze the data\u201d on the achievement gap, discuss the issue, and look at the issue as early as preschool. \u201cI think that the achievement gap happens before our students even hit school,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cPreschool is going to be an important part of our future discussions in the school system. \u201cThe predictor is there, we know that kids who don\u2019t pass the third grade [Standards of Learning] test are generally the ones who don\u2019t have preschool and that predicts a high probability of dropping out later.\u201d TWU organized the forum as a venue for community members to get to know who the candidates are and come away with a better understanding of their thoughts on issues that most closely affect the black and Latino community in Alexandria. The Special Education Advisory Committee is holding the next scheduled public forum \u2014 for all candidates \u2014 on March 31 at Minnie Howard, with the time yet to be determined. On April 20, the Upper King Street Neighborhood Association is co-hosting a forum for District A candidates with the Inner City Civic Association and the Old Town Civic Association at the Durant Center (7:30 p.m.) The Departmental Progressive Club has organized its public forum for April 29 (7 p.m.). The Alexandria PTA Council will host three forums, one for each district: the District A forum is planned for April 22 at Mt. Vernon, District B on April 20 at Minnie Howard and District C on April 27 at Samuel Tucker.

It\u2019s not as simple a concept as the traditional Santa Claus delivering presents to a struggling family at Christmas, but the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the federal stimulus package, has City Hall creating a wish list for the money\u2019s allocation. And the complexity of the funding has the city checking that list over and over and over again. The proposed list, comprised of needs from city departments, once consisted of hundreds of projects worth over $600 million on which the city hoped to capitalize. Officials did not expect to receive that vast amount of funding, but dubbed it part of their vetting process to allocate the money. Since President Barack Obama signed the Act, that list has been narrowed down to about 25 to 30 projects, according to Mayor Bill Euille. But receiving stimulus money and implementing it in the city\u2019s best interest seems to be consumed by the dense bureaucracy of federal lawmaking and the fluid nature of the stimulus package itself. Some money will also go through the state to be allocated by Governor Tim Kaine. \u201cEverything is changing on the dime, hour by hour, day by day,\u201d Euille said, a day after spending four hours on the Hill with other mayors and Congressional delegations. Officials would not prioritize the various projects they hope to achieve, but have set up an intergovernmental system to monitor the myriad stipulations and rules crowding around the free money. Essentially, it is a task force that will make sure projects fundable by the Act won\u2019t fall through the cracks while making sure projects that qualify meet the necessary criteria. The City Council will have ultimate say, according to a memo that places the body at the top of the chain, and although the city has its own priorities, they do not always parallel the funding available from the stimulus package. The city will have to prioritize according to other factors as well, like speed. \u201cExpediency will be important, and those projects that are \u2018shovel ready\u2019 will be more likely to receive federal funding,\u201d stated City Manager Jim Hartmann in a memo to the mayor and City Council that reflected a briefing from Congressman Jim Moran (D \u2013 8). \u201cCertainly we have some potential to do things that were not otherwise on the priority list but are important long-range projects,\u201d City Manager Jim Hartmann said. \u201cMuch of the energy efficiency items \u2014they have a long term payback for the city. So frankly we welcome those things.\u201d The most recent published wish list (which consists of much more than 30 projects), contains everything from restructuring the city marina to repaving Interstate 395 to helping victims of the recession. Among 12 other committees in the workflow, the implementation committee has the job of obtaining the actual grant funding for such projects as well as clearing any hurdles to obtaining funding. \u201cThe implementation committee is going to look for, primarily, barriers to implementation,\u201d Hartmann said. \u201cIf we have a priority project [we will] move it as fast as we can while being mindful of the rules and regulations that we have in the city.\u201d Money from the stimulus package was not accounted for in the city\u2019s current proposed budget, so some of the money could supplant or offset budget gaps, even if the city cannot use them as part of the budget, perhaps having to utilize itemized grants based on the stimulus plan\u2019s stipulations. \u201cThe devil\u2019s going to be in the details,\u201d Hartmann said. \u201cWhether certain stimulus spending might be seen as supplanting the budget depends on if it\u2019s allowed or not. If there are things in the budget where we could use stimulus funds instead of using city funds that could be used for other critical areas, certainly those will be considered. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to calculate what that net benefit may be. I think there will be a smaller portion of offsetting things within the budget, but it will be able to help us accomplish other goals that maybe were not funded in this budget.\u201d Citing the fluid nature of the process and the numerous departments in line and in need for funding, officials would not prioritize one project over another. But Hartmann gave the \u201cclassic\u201d example of Polk School Gymnasium, a \u201cshovel ready\u201d project that has already been designed and is awaiting funding to be realized. Still, it is not yet certain if the project has a money pot available. \u201cI don\u2019t have the authority to say this project is going to go ahead of that project,\u201d Euille said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a total collaboration because we have every department and agency involved.\u201d There is no distinct timeline on when final decisions will occur; it will take more time for the bill\u2019s contents to take a tangible shape and the city will be doing more evaluations and setting priorities \u201cI think the next two months are going to be very instrumental on what we\u2019re going to be doing,\u201d Hartmann said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Interstate 395", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

This fall, the classical education is coming back to Alexandria, but almost half a year and several large hurdles remain before the school can officially open its doors. The move to establish the Washington Latin School, led by T.R. Ahlstrom and Headmaster Tom Soule, is gearing up for the start to its academic calendar on September 8 at a location yet to be determined in Old Town. The school hopes to attract students with a rigorous, classics-based curriculum and a significantly reduced tuition, due to the current economy. Students enrolling for the school\u2019s first year will pay an annual tuition of $14,000, plus other fees, during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years, roughly $10,000 less than the original sticker price. Once the school\u2019s financial base is strong enough, Ahlstrom and Soule plan to admit students on a partial- or full-scholarship basis \u2014 the founders are aware that the $24,000 average price tag is not possible for everyone \u2014 making it financially viable for students from lower-income backgrounds to attend. \u201cMy take on this, and T.R. and I have talked about this before, is \u2018classics for everyone,\u2019\u201d Soule said. \u201cFar too often that kind of education isn\u2019t available to people of all socio-economic backgrounds.\u201d Ahlstrom said that the results found at the Washington Latin Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., one of two public Latin schools that he has helped found in the last seven years \u2014 Bronx Latin in New York City is the other \u2014 prove that people of all economic backgrounds can thrive in the demanding, classical setting. Currently, there are three locations in Old Town being looked at as the school\u2019s initial home, Soule and Ahlstrom said. The educational philosophy at the Washington Latin School in Alexandria is somewhat similar to Ahlstrom\u2019s previous two endeavors, but is setting out as an independent, privately funded school rather than one receiving public funds. \u201cThis is my third school in the last seven years,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cThe other projects were very successful, and we believe this one will be more successful because we\u2019ve chosen not to do it as a public school, but as an independent, co-educational classical school. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a basher of public schools, I\u2019m a product of them. The fact of the matter is that there is one kind of school in this country for prosperous people and another kind of education for everyone else.\u201d Both Ahlstrom and Soule worked at the Washington Latin School Charter School before leaving in late 2007 to start the independent school venture. Soule said that by then, they \u201chad reached a ceiling\u201d with what they were able to do educationally at the charter school and wanted to move on to a new situation that would allow for more independence. According to Soule and Charter School Board meeting minutes, the D.C. Charter School Board disagreed with Ahlstrom\u2019s proposal to move the school from Northwest D.C. to Penn Quarter and ultimately nixed the idea. The charter school\u2019s current headmaster, Martha Cutts, came on after Ahlstrom and Soule left, but said that in the time since the school has continued to flourish, swelling to 341 students this year from 179 only two years before. In 2008, the school opened a second campus in D.C. for its eighth and ninth graders, and applications for the upcoming school year are up 74 percent, Cutts said. While it appears the charter school is established and growing, the Washington Latin School in Alexandria has its own set of hurdles to clear. Getting students and their families to move away from their current schools could be considered one of the project\u2019s biggest obstacles, but Ahlstrom and Soule are confident that the niche they\u2019re trying to fill with the Washington Latin School is one that will not struggle to attract students. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem getting kids and families to commit,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cEvery school we\u2019ve ever done, there\u2019s a long line at the door. There will be here, too. The real challenge is funding without getting public money.\u201d Donna Molinari of Alexandria Country Day School said that the Latin School is starting in much the same way that ACDS did in the 1980s, and that based on the differences in curriculum the new school probably would not affect its enrollment too much. \u201cI think they have their reputation behind them to help propel them forward, and it\u2019s a curriculum that\u2019s been around for a while, and that will help them,\u201d Molinari said. \u201cOf course, the hurdles are those that all new schools face, and are affected even more so in a tough economic climate.\u201d During a March 17 public meeting at Charles Beatley Library, Ahlstrom dove into some of the financing they\u2019re looking for with the new school. Aside from tuition for the students enrolling in the first year \u2014 fifth grade, sixth grade and seventh grade only \u2014 the school is looking for 10 \u201cfounding families,\u201d each of whom would pay $100,000 in the first year, covering the child\u2019s tuition through graduation. In addition, the school is looking for 12 individuals or corporations to contribute $200,000 each over the next five years in order to solidify the school\u2019s financial base. \u201cIs it hard work? Yes. Is it more difficult because of this economy? Of course,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked the question, \u2018How can we turn this negative economy in a positive thing?\u2019 And I think we\u2019ve done that.\u201d The plan is to add a new higher and lower grade each year, but for the first year the school is hoping to draw about 50 students, enough for a single cohort of fifth, sixth and seventh grade students. Alexandria City Public Schools, experiencing its own enrollment increase, are not expecting the new school to affect what they do to any great extent, but are eager to see what comes about, Director of Communications Amy Carlini said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how it works out,\u201d Carlini said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see what happens.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Old Town", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Old Town", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Washington", "latitude": 38.8951, "longitude": -77.0364}, {"name": "D.C.", "latitude": 38.9171, "longitude": -77.0003}, {"name": "New York City", "latitude": 40.7143, "longitude": -74.006}, {"name": "Old Town", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Washington", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "D.C.", "latitude": 38.9171, "longitude": -77.0003}, {"name": "D.C.", "latitude": 38.9171, "longitude": -77.0003}, {"name": "Penn Quarter", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "D.C.", "latitude": 38.9171, "longitude": -77.0003}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}, {"name": "Alexandria", "latitude": 38.8048, "longitude": -77.0469}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

As unfavorable ideas go, this one is a corker, as far as Egypt is concerned. The choices that confront Sudan preoccupy Egypt. One danger, for both Egypt and Sudan, lies in failing to think clearly about short term and long term. In the short term, peace in Darfur is a priority for both Egypt and Sudan. In the long term, Sudan's territorial integrity and national sovereignty are at stake. \"Egypt seeks peace and we don't have a hidden agenda,\" President Hosni Mubarak declared. Egypt proposed a United Nations conference to discuss the ICC indictment of Bashir, even though the Sudanese government declined Cairo's bid on the pretext that it might lead to the internationalisation of the issue. Southern Sudan is rich in economic resources, which attracts Western and Asian, especially Chinese, interests out to make a quick kill. With this in mind, Egypt understands the gravity of the threat that faces Sudan. Peacekeepers have a deplorable record in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their failure to protect civilians from ill-disciplined government troops and pro-government militias is proverbial. In Sudan the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) has so far kept a relatively low profile. Some 1,500 Egyptian troops are currently stationed in Darfur, even though certain Darfur armed opposition groups objected to the Egyptian participation in UNAMID, most notably the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Army. Egypt was one of the first countries to send its UNAMID contingency to Darfur. In the turbulent aftermath of the ICC indictment of Sudanese President Al-Bashir the future of the hitherto buoyant Sudanese economy may be in jeopardy. \"This is the last thing Egypt wants. Egypt would like to see a prosperous, politically stable and peaceful Sudan,\" El-Feki explained. \"Egypt is poised for participating positively in Sudan's economic uplift.\" \"As far as Egypt is concerned, the indictment of President Al-Bashir by the ICC would have a detrimental impact on the Sudanese economy. That is neither in the interest of Sudan nor Egypt,\" El-Feki added. The cost to Sudan of withholding aid might be high at a time of global penny- pinching. But the consequences of inaction will be far higher. It is against this backdrop that Egypt is prepared to help Sudan in any fashion the Sudanese people require. Sudan is bracing itself for a big bang and a perfect storm. The country stands at the crossroads. This is a testing time for the current and future administrations of Sudan, and Egyptian officials are acutely conscious of the Sudanese conundrum and are at pains to explain that they would back whatever decisions the Sudanese people adopt. If push comes to shove, managing a potentially tricky Sudanese transition will not be easy. Moreover, it would be a protracted affair and may prove awkward for both Egypt and Sudan. For all these reasons, Egypt assumes its responsibilities to drive forward this necessary new Sudan. Tacit agreement to do nothing would be dangerous for both neighbours. There are other reasons for caution. The need for dialogue between all the rival Sudanese factions is pivotal. \"It is for this reason that Egypt attempts to maintain close contacts with all the various political groups, both government and opposition,\" El-Feki stressed. \"At the same time we should work on initiatives to drive forward a more productive, more democratic Sudan,\" he concluded. Egypt may not have much leverage over Sudan, but a rift in bilateral relations between Egypt and its neighbour to its immediate south will be detrimental to both countries. The balkanisation of Sudan will come at a time when Egypt can least afford it. \"But this is a question for the Sudanese people to determine.\" \"We are only concerned about Sudan's interests and the welfare of its people,\" Mubarak stated categorically. He dispatched Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul- Gheit and General Intelligence Chief Omar Suleiman to the Sudanese capital Khartoum to discuss the latest crisis concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for President Omar Al-Bashir. Egyptian officials concur that the primary purpose of Egypt's solidarity with Sudan is to advance the interests of the \"two fraternal neighbouring states,\" as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the People's Assembly Mustafa El-Feki told . \"Sudan constitutes the strategic depth of Egypt and is key to its water security and potentially for its food security too. Sudan's agricultural potential is tremendous and yet untapped. Egypt is prepared to step up its agricultural investment in Sudan.

One prediction about Sri Lankan political developments in 2009 that can be made with absolute confidence is that wanton terrorist acts of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) will not diminish. This is partly because the have-nots and in particular disgruntled elements of the ethnic Tamil minority have many grievances. Talk about incorporating the Tamil community more in the decision-making process of the island- nation nonetheless continue and the former deputy leader of the LTTE Vinyagamoorthi Muralitharan has been appointed non- cabinet minister for natural integration and reconciliation. Many Tamil separatists have come round to accept that unless they start at least to talk about their own eventual disarmament and incorporation into the Sri Lankan political establishment, they will find it extremely hard to get many of the ethnic Sinhalese majority on their side. However, many Sri Lanka analysts believe that peace is just a pipe dream. If the Tamil moderates show no sign of living up to this side of the bargain, the Sinhalese majority's resentment will multiply and will become less and less willing to agree to further power-sharing schemes. There was a time when many influential Tamils had opted for independence. Centuries of progroms and panics taught Tamils that the Sinhalese leaders always have a better hand than their own Tamil leaders. But here is a paradox. There are important segments of the Tamil community with a vested interest in preserving the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. However wonderful in theory it is to remove the Tamil Tigers' threat once and for all, incidents such as the unfortunate terrorist attack on Tuesday denote the notion of relegating the LTTE to the sidelines like so much pie in the sky. The hard-headed practitioners of realpolitik like Sri Lanka's former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga will not for the moment be joining the fray. Oddly enough what will drive the incessant talk about elevating the status of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka are the hardliners of the ruling party. Nobody in the Sri Lankan political establishment is certain that the LTTE will honour a later promise to disarm. Divisions in the ruling United People's Congress of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse do not inhibit the government's resolve to end the LTTE uprising. The Sri Lankan civil war, which erupted in 1972 when LTTE took up arms against the government, has so far claimed the lives of some 70,000 people. When historians look back on his presidency, they may well judge him most on whether he managed to quell the Tamil uprising. According to the pro-LTTE Tamilnet website, 75 civilians were killed last week as a result of Sri Lankan government army shelling of LTTE-administered areas of the island. It is estimated that around 200,000 civilians were trapped in the war zone in the northern parts of the country. The Sri Lankan government accuses the LTTE of using the civilian Tamil population as human shields, but by all accounts, the LTTE appears to be losing the battles on the ground and resorting in desperation instead to its timeworn tradition of terrorism. Tamil separatists can be said to have invented suicide bombing and hold the record, a most sorry one. The participation of senior government officials in a Muslim festival was a show of sectarian solidarity, which renders the attack all the more poignant. The suicide bombing occurred in the town of Akuressa, in Matara district some 160km south of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The Sri Lankan government is now taking stock and looking at how these figures are adding up. Hopes are high that things will get better. The Sinhalese political establishment will have to re-sell what contemporary Sri Lanka stands for. They will be tested by the Tamils' terrorist acts. Ambassador Ansar explained that the bombing was supposed to cause maximum damage and loss of life. Sri Lanka has a Muslim population of more than two million, geographically concentrated in the eastern part of the country. They have generally been neutral in the war between Tamils and Sinhalese, refusing to take sides. The leader of the Tamil separatists Veluppillai Prabhakaran is still at large and sporadic armed conflict in the north of the island is expected to continue unabated even though the observers anticipate an escalation of terrorist attacks throughout the island nation and perhaps even against Sri Lankan interests overseas. Ambassador Ansar, a Sri Lankan Muslim himself, noted that peace will inevitably be a long, drawn out process. \"We will need all the support we can muster from our allies overseas. The international community must extend its cooperation in face of terrorism and we must fight together.\" Yes, it has been a traumatic week for Sri Lanka. Some 14 people were killed and scores were injured, including Sri Lanka's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Mahinda Wijesekara, as they joined thousands of pilgrims to the holy shrine at the historic mosque at Godapitiya. No less than six ministers took part in the celebratory procession marking \"This is a barbaric attack on innocent civilians. The LTTE had suffered a series of military setbacks in the past year and has been cornered in the northeastern part of the island.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Godapitiya", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sinhalese", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sinhalese", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sinhalese", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Akuressa", "latitude": 6.09639, "longitude": 80.4808}, {"name": "Matara", "latitude": 5.94861, "longitude": 80.5428}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Colombo", "latitude": 6.93194, "longitude": 79.8478}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sinhalese", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sinhalese", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lankan", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Sri Lanka", "latitude": 7.0, "longitude": 81.0}, {"name": "Godapitiya", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Ahli can sleep a bit more comfortably after Petrojet beat Ismaili on Monday 1-0. The win stymied Ismaili's attempt to catch Ahli, the defending champions, who remain atop the leader board with 42 points after 21 games. Enppi and Petrojet are tied with 39 points and 22 games played. Ismaili drop to fourth on 38 points after 21 games. Observers say Ahli are lucky to still be in the lead after collecting just three points from their last four matches. Ismaili, who seeks to win their first league title since 2002, had blown the title race wide open with a 1-0 victory over a depleted Ahli side at Cairo Stadium. That was followed by a 0-0 draw in which 10-man Ahli failed to find their way through Police Union's tight defence. They also could not avenge their 1-0 defeat to Talaat Youssef's side in the first half of the season. Ahli's mercurial midfielder Mohamed Barakat was sent off in the second half for picking up two yellow cards, one for simulation in the penalty area and another for a clumsy tackle on a Police defender. Palestinian keeper Ramzi Saleh made his third successive start, replacing the error-prone Amir Abdul-Hamid and did admirably in keeping his net clean. Ahli coach Manuel Jose made two substitutions during the second half in a bid to improve his side's attack. Strikers Hani El-Egeizi and Ahmed Belal were introduced to play alongside Flavio but the pair, who do not play regularly, were obviously not fit. Jose's plans suffered another blow after Barakat received his marching orders six minutes past the hour mark for lunging at an opponent. The Portuguese tactician was forced to substitute Angolan hitman Flavio with right-back Ahmed Sedik. Ahli kept pushing forward despite their numerical disadvantage but failed to carve out any clear-cut chances. Police held firm to secure a share of the spoils with the defending champions. Police Union moved to ninth place on 27 points, seven clear of the relegation zone. Ahli assistant coach Hossam El-Badri refused to blame referee Gehad Greisha for his side's goalless draw. \"I can't say that the referee cost us a win. He did not make any profound mistakes,\" El-Badri stated. \"Our players played well but were unlucky in the first half and matters went from bad to worse when Barakat was sent off. \"The competition will be fierce in the upcoming games, but I don't want Ahli supporters to be worried because we are determined to keep our title.\" Indeed, Ismaili's loss to Petrojet did go quite a ways to Ahli capturing their fifth straight league crown. Police assistant coach Mohamed Ibrahim lauded his team's defence that put Ahli strikers at bay throughout the match. \"We were aware that Ahli will keep pushing forward during the whole game,\" Ibrahim said. \"Credit our defenders for successfully marking Ahli. We succeeded in achieving our target of avoiding a defeat.\" Elsewhere, no sooner had Zamalek ended a six-game run without a win by beating Enppi 1-0 than they failed to build on their win by losing 2-1 to Haras Al-Hedoud and equal their worst record of nine Egyptian Premier League defeats in one season. Egyptian Cup winners Haras Al-Hedoud, who will play in next season's CAF Confederation Cup, moved into fourth place on 36 points as they continued their impressive form under manager Tarek El-Ashri. Al-Hedoud managed to break the deadlock after just five minutes. Ahmed Abdel-Ghani curled a superb free- kick over the wall and into the corner of the net past the hapless Abdel-Wahed Al-Sayed. Zamalek defender Amr El-Safti thought he had equalised shortly afterwards after Al-Hedoud keeper Mathurin Kameni spilled a tame cross into his path, but his goal was ruled offside. Zamalek still had better possession but rarely threatened Kameni as the efficient Al-Hedoud doubled their advantage on 27 minutes. Talented midfielder Abdel-Salam Nagah whipped in a pinpoint cross from the right and Abdel-Hamid Bassiouni rose above the static Amr Adel to head home. Sherif Ashraf, who came on as a second-half substitute, pulled one back with 13 minutes remaining but the hosts held onto their lead to claim all three points. Despite their defeat, Zamalek assistant coach Sami El-Sheshini was pleased with his side's performance. \"We are gradually improving. We played a very good game tonight, especially in the second half,\" El-Sheshini told reporters after the match. \"I just want Zamalek fans to be patient. The players produced promising displays and I'm sure the results will be better in the upcoming matches,\" El-Sheshini added. After the loss to Al-Hedoud, Zamalek lie ninth in the league table on 27 points, seven above the relegation zone. In other matches, Enppi remained in the title race with a 1-0 victory over Egypt Telecom, failing to end a 12-match winless streak in manager Hossam Hassan's debut. Al-Gaish produced an impressive display to beat Ittihad 4-1 on Saturday. The big win lifts Al-Gaish to eighth in the table with 29 points. Ittihad remain sixth, one point ahead of Farouk Gaafar's men. Ernest Papa Arku broke the deadlock for Gaish on 33 minutes, before a brace from Salah Amin (63, 81) and a 90th minute strike by Yassine Abdul-Aal sealed the win. Mohamed Ragab scored Ittihad's consolation in the 83rd minute. In Port Said, Tersana showed determination to remain in the first division by beating Misri 2-0. Ismaili were handed a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Esperance in the Arab Champions League (ACL) quarter-final first leg played in Tunisia last week. Mickael Eneramo broke the deadlock on 27 minutes before Oussama Darragi doubled Esperance's lead in the second half while Mohab Said scored a vital away goal for Ismaili 12 minutes from time. The home side opened the scoreline when Abdel-Hamid Sami brought down Michael Eneramo in the box. The Nigerian successfully sent Mohamed Sobhi the wrong way. As the Egyptian club tried to push for an equaliser, they were exposed at the back and Esperance looked closer to adding a second. Early in the second half, Eneramo was once again allowed to go one on one with Sobhi but the 28-year-old net minder did well to keep the shot out. In the 73rd minute, Darragi added his team's second by capitalising on some poor defending from Ismaili to slot home past the helpless Sobhi. Ismaili were brought back to life when Abdullah Saied's cross found Said unguarded on the far post, the midfielder easily heading past Kasraoui. The two teams will clash again in the tie's second leg in a week's time in Ismailia.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Cairo Stadium", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Zamalek", "latitude": 30.0667, "longitude": 31.2167}, {"name": "Zamalek", "latitude": 30.0667, "longitude": 31.2167}, {"name": "Zamalek", "latitude": 30.0667, "longitude": 31.2167}, {"name": "Zamalek", "latitude": 30.0667, "longitude": 31.2167}, {"name": "Zamalek", "latitude": 30.0667, "longitude": 31.2167}, {"name": "Port Said", "latitude": 31.2598, "longitude": 32.3005}, {"name": "Tunisia", "latitude": 34.0, "longitude": 9.0}, {"name": "Ismailia", "latitude": 30.6047, "longitude": 32.2769}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Since Obama took office, hopes for better times spread over the Middle East. Egypt, which often had trouble communicating with the administration of George Bush Jr, is now hoping for improved bilateral ties. At least since the 1970s, three main themes dominated Egyptian-US relations: the peace process, the situation in the Gulf, and financial assistance. These themes may offer us some guidance as to how the future will look. Egyptian-US partnership regarding the peace process started in earnest with Jimmy Carter, who sponsored the Camp David Accords and the subsequent Egyptian- Israeli Peace Treaty. The sense of mutual commitment to peace survived throughout the administration of George Bush Sr and his secretary of state James Baker, culminating in the Madrid Conference for peace in the Middle East in 1991, the international gathering that endorsed the \"land-for-peace\" formula. The second theme of cooperation was Gulf security. During Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Egypt was instrumental in forming the international coalition to roll back the invasion. The third theme was US assistance to Egypt which, despite what its detractors may say, has helped rebuild Egypt's infrastructure for the past few decades. During the 1990s, economic assistance began to be phased out. And certain efforts were made through the Mubarak-Gore partnership to create a free trade zone as an option to help the Egyptian economy. But the Clinton and Bush Jr administrations didn't pursue that option in earnest. Cooperation on all three of these issues diminished during the presidency of George Bush Jr. The Palestinian problem, in particular, suffered as a result. The Bush administration started out by blaming the Clinton administration for involving the US too greatly in the Arab-Israeli conflict. US indifference concerning the Palestinian problem continued until the Bush administration finally admitted that something needed to be done. Subsequently, the administration said that it favoured a two-state solution. US rhetoric, however, was not matched by action. On the contrary, the Bush Jr administration undermined the concept of a geographically-connected Palestinian state when, during a visit by Israel's prime minister to the US in July 2004, it said that Israel may hold on to major settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. And for all the visits by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to the region, the Bush administration failed to come up with cohesive policy on the Palestinian issue and largely ignored the question of settlements. It was only recently, and timidly, that Rice admitted during her last visit to the region that the building of settlements was not helping the cause of peace. As for cooperation over Gulf security, this cooperation receded when the Bush administration ignored the warnings and advice of Egypt and invaded Iraq. The invasion, as we know now, sowed only turmoil in the region. It damaged the US's image, increased terror, and turned Iran into a key regional power. Another thing that marred Egyptian relations with the previous US administration was the latter's misguided ideas on democratisation. American arguments were often viewed in Egypt, even by civil society organisations, as interference in Egyptian internal affairs. This brief survey of Egyptian-US relations shows that Egypt cooperated closely with Washington at times when US policies were positive, as in the times of Carter and George Bush Sr. But tensions were unavoidable during the time of Bush Jr. Much now hinges on the US taking a fresh view of the Arab- Israeli conflict, one that casts away the conventional bias towards Israel that has so far undermined the quest for an acceptable solution. Much depends also on what the Obama administration does about extracting itself from the Iraq morass, restoring peace and stability there and the Gulf, and handling the Iranian nuclear issue. This analysis may seem to suggest that responsibility for moving forward on Egyptian-US relations rests solely with the US. Of course, this cannot be true. Egypt, for its part, needs to build its credibility in the region. If anything, this would persuade the Americans that Egypt is a country one should listen to, even when one doesn't totally agree with what it says.

Apart from Shimon Peres giving Hillary Clinton a kiss on the cheek, nothing much emerged from the first visit to the Middle East of the new US secretary of state. We have no indication of where the policies of the Obama administration are heading. Actually, it seems so far that there is no tangible change from the policies of the former administration. During her visit to Israel, Clinton spoke in favour of the two-state solution but said she has no intention of talking to Hamas. Clinton had nothing to say about the need for Israel to stop building settlements all over Palestinian land. Nor did she have anything to say about the Gaza tragedy. She didn't mention the need to open the crossings and follow up on the efforts Egypt is making to bring about a calming down period. And yet Clinton made a point of empathising with Israel with regards to Palestinian rockets. And she fully understood Israel's concern over the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons. Clinton kept her options open concerning future talks with Syria and Iran. Washington seems prepared to engage the Syrians in dialogue if this helps Damascus distance itself from Tehran. And the Syrians seem willing to go to any lengths to stay on Washington's good side. It seems that the US wants to see moderate Arabs and Palestinians negotiating with Israel, although actually the Palestinians have been doing just that for quite some time now to no avail. Israel expressed strong reservations about any negotiations with Tehran, and obtained a promise that Washington wouldn't formulate its policy regarding the Iranian nuclear question without consulting with Israeli officials first. And it seems that Clinton bought Livni's claim that moderate Arab countries are more concerned about Iran than Israel. Some Arab countries were ecstatic that Clinton's first visit to the region started in Sharm El-Sheikh, where she attended a conference for the reconstruction of Gaza. I don't know how relevant this is to anything. What I know is that Arab countries have failed to ask for anything specific. They have failed to come up with a cohesive view and to relay it to the Americans. At present, the Arabs have no policy for dealing with an Israeli right-wing government led by Netanyahu. The designated prime minister has never showed any interest in peace, aside from what he sees as \"economic peace\"; namely, any arrangement that allows Israel to exploit the resources of the region at will. It may be too early to speculate on the future of the region as Washington sees it. But by the look of things it seems that Washington is hoping that the region will turn against Tehran and all radical groups affiliated with it. But what's in it for us? Hostility to Iran can only benefit Israel and divide the Arab world. It would be a continuation of the same circumstances that led to the tragedy in Gaza. Clinton came to the region with Iran on her mind. The main issue -- namely, the Arab-Israeli conflict -- is not being addressed for now. And it is unlikely to be broached before a new Israeli government is formed. I know some people are hoping to see Clinton give her backing to Egyptian efforts for a calming-down period in Palestine and for inter-Palestinian reconciliation. But I find it worrisome that we still have no idea how the Obama administration might react to someone like Lieberman becoming Israel's next foreign minister. The man is a racist who insulted the Egyptian president, threatened to bomb the High Dam, and described the Palestinians as insects. How will Washington deal with such a man?

It joins an already approved 65,000-square-foot Whole Foods on the former site of the John M. Smyth Homemakers building razed last summer.

A federal grand jury in Milwaukee has returned a three-count indictment against a Chicago couple accused of posing as destitute Kenyan refugees and scamming Carmelite nuns in Pewaukee out of more than $800,000. Acting U.S. Attorney Michelle Jacobs announced the indictment Tuesday charging 35-year-old Angela Martin-Mulu and 39-year-old Edward Bosire with mail fraud. The two Kenyan citizens arrived in the U.S. in 1999 and received political asylum in 2007. The indictment said the two targeted religious orders by claiming they suffered from illnesses and needed money for medical bills or education, at the same time maintaining apartments in Chicago and Bolingbrook, Ill., and spending much of the money at casinos or on things unrelated to medical or educational expenses. An FBI affidavit has said the married couple first visited the Pewaukee monastery in December 2004 and told the nuns they were brother and sister, homeless and would be killed if they were deported to Kenya.

Last summer, a crypto outbreak scared plenty of people away from public pools and water parks across North Texas. \"No system will completely take crypto out of a pool,\" said Chris Swartz, NRH{-2}O manager. \"But this is state-of-the-art in recreational water management.\" The ultraviolet disinfection system is among the approaches cities and private water park operators are taking to address what has become a serious problem. Last year, 476 cases of crypto were reported throughout Tarrant County. In July, crypto was discovered in the water of Burger\u2019s Lake in west Fort Worth; a swimmer was identified as the source of the infection. Throughout the summer, cases of crypto were reported and linked to various public pools. Crypto cases are on the rise in Texas and nationwide and health officials aren\u2019t sure why. Last year in Texas there were 1,981 confirmed cases, up from 233 in 2007, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The increase might be due to heightened awareness of the parasite and increased reporting, said Michele Hlavsa, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Instead of thinking 'Where did I eat?\u2019 people are thinking 'Where did I swim?\u2019 \" she said. What makes crypto so difficult to deal with is its resistance to normal levels of chlorine and ability to survive more than 10 days in water. Many area cities plan to hyperchlorinate, or shock, pool water using high amounts of chorine. While that is an effective way to treat crypto, it cannot prevent an outbreak. The best thing people can do is avoid swimming if they have been sick, said David Jefferson, environmental health manager for Tarrant County Public Health. \"What people have to remember is when you are in a swimming pool, you are in other people\u2019s bodily fluids,\" he said. Even an ultraviolet system has limitations. The devices work by interfering with the DNA of a parasite, making it unable to reproduce. But the parasite must pass through the ultraviolet system, which can take six hours, before it comes back into the pool clean. \"Before all the water gets treated, crypto is still sitting in the water,\" Hlavsa said. Hyperchlorination does a great job of lowering the amount of crypto in a pool, but it doesn\u2019t have a lasting effect, Hlavsa said. Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, which had no crypto cases last year, is among several facilities planning to hyperchlorinate its pools. \"It\u2019s the easiest and most effective thing to do,\" park spokeswoman Sharon Parker said. Keller has considered a UV system but for now will focus on educating the public about healthy swimming habits and following the public health department\u2019s recommendations, said Dona Roth Kinney, director of parks and recreation. The bottom line is that it\u2019s up to people to prevent an outbreak by avoiding public pools for 10 days if they have had gastrointestinal symptoms, Jefferson said. \"Swimmers are bringing it into the pools, and they\u2019re the ones who can keep it out,\" he said. Wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers. Change diapers in a bathroom or diaper-changing area and not at poolside. Wash children thoroughly with soap and water before they go swimming.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "North Texas", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Tarrant County", "latitude": 32.7668, "longitude": -97.3003}, {"name": "Burger\u2019s Lake", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Fort Worth", "latitude": 32.7254, "longitude": -97.3208}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Tarrant County", "latitude": 32.7668, "longitude": -97.3003}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

ARLINGTON \u2014 The City Council voted 8-1 Tuesday to approve a gas-drilling site on a picturesque horse farm in north Arlington. Titan Operating was granted a specific-use permit to drill on 3.5 acres of Martha Rose May Martin\u2019s 40-acre horse farm at North Cooper Street and Green Oaks Boulevard. Titan, which has not drilled in Arlington before, plans to drill 20 wells on Martin\u2019s farm over five years. The company spent more than $23 million acquiring mineral rights from 2,200 property owners surrounding the site. On Tuesday night, more than 200 residents packed City Hall to weigh in on the proposal, most to voice support. Among those in favor of the site was former Mayor Elzie Odom, who was one of 2,200 property owners in the North Arlington Neighbors association who signed a lease with Titan last year. Martin told the council that the decision to allow drilling on her property, which features open pastures, rolling hills and grazing horses, was not taken lightly. \"I have a profound love and connection with my property, which has been owned by my family for six generations,\" she said. \"This property is a little bit of heaven for my family and neighbors.\" Councilman Robert Rivera, who represents southeast Arlington, voted against the permit, saying he shared concerns about safety and property values with residents near the site. Three months ago, the city\u2019s Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously rejected Titan\u2019s request. Commissioners did not publicly comment on why they denied the permit, but city staff and council members have expressed concerns about the gas wells\u2019 impact on the land\u2019s future development, the visibility of the wells from busy Cooper Street, and the effects of an industrial operation on property values and quality of life. Cliff Mycoskie, who presented Titan\u2019s permit request to council, said the gas company has agreed to implement several measures that will reduce the operation\u2019s impact. Among them, he said: Titan will use urban drilling rigs, which require less energy to run and can be assembled more quickly, put up sound buffers, limit truck traffic during peak hours and install a masonry fence and landscaping along Cooper Street before drilling begins, which could be as soon as next year. Mycoskie pointed out that farther north, Huffines Communities wants to build a master planned community on undeveloped land across from the city landfill that already has numerous natural gas drilling sites. The community, called Viridian, will feature a town center and homes ranging from $300,000 to more than $1 million. \"If it worked at Viridian, it can work at this site, too,\" Cliff said. Those who spoke in opposition, many of whom live within 600 feet of the site, said they were concerned about the safety of living so close to an industrial site and the negative effects on property values. They also said they were disappointed to lose the peace and great view they have from living so close to the farm. Melinda Vanderberg, who lives on Bucknell Drive, urged the council to consider alternate sites away from the neighborhood. \"This site is literally in my back yard. There are many families and they live dangerously close to this industrial drill site that is going to go on for seven years,\" she said. Resident Landry Burdine said nearby drilling sites on Washington Drive and at Rolling Hills Country Club could extract the gas. \"This is not a necessary drill site. There are ample drills sites to serve this area,\" said Burdine, a developer who put together the deal to acquire and demolish the dilapidated Madison Creek and Hampton Hills apartment complexes on Washington Drive to make way for a natural gas drilling site. Supporters of the permit said they believe Titan will keep its promises to minimize the effects of the drilling and preserve the horse farm\u2019s character.

School districts aren't yet laying off teachers, but most in Northeast Georgia either are reviewing or changing policies that will allow them to fire veteran teachers if they need to. The policies make seniority less of a priority when deciding which teachers to keep and which ones to let go - part of a trend that started more than 10 years ago to allow school districts to keep newer teachers with promise even if they had to cut positions. Last week, the Clarke County Board of Education began to take public comment on a new policy that would replace a 25-year-old rule that made seniority the only factor when administrators eliminate jobs. And in January, the Oconee County school board made similar changes to its policy, deciding to use a ranking system for seniority as a secondary measure to evaluate the value of an employee. Most Northeast Georgia school systems haven't had to consider layoff policies - dubbed \"reduction-in-force plans\" - for two decades because enrollment growth forced schools to hire more and more. But enrollment has slowed in places like Jackson and Barrow counties - which were among the fastest-growing counties in the state a few years ago - and since state funding is tied to enrollment, that means less state funding. Plus, the state reduced funding for public schools across the board by 2 percent this year, while next year's plans call for an additional 3 percent reduction - worth about $7.3 million for a school system like Barrow County. To make up for funding cuts, schools have implemented a hiring freeze and are not replacing many teachers who retire or move away. At the same time, property values and sales tax revenues are stagnant, meaning there is likely to be less local money for schools. As administrators consider cutting staff, some systems are revisiting their policies to make sure they can keep teachers with stellar records and teachers who can coach or have an in-demand specialty like special education, even if they have fewer years on the job. While Clarke and Oconee update their layoff policies, school boards in Barrow, Jackson and Madison counties tweaked their own only a few years ago. Under the newer policies, even tenured teachers who work in a district for more than four years aren't guaranteed they'll keep their jobs, said Phil Hartley, an attorney for the Georgia School Boards Association. \"It's becoming harder and harder to justify 'How do we get rid of the five-year teacher whose test scores are superior to the 20-year veteran teacher's?\" Hartley said. \"The school district has to have a way of making a decision based on criteria that it feels it can fairly apply for a reduction in force.\" School administrators still will consider a teacher's seniority, but only after looking at job evaluations, classroom observations and test scores. Seniority-based layoff policies still are the standard for most large school districts. Today, all but five of the nation's 25 largest school districts use seniority as a basis for cutting staff, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality, a Washington-based organization that encourages stronger state teacher-quality policies. Still, basing layoff decisions on more subjective standards may have flaws, too, said Tim Callahan, a spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators. \"If performance would be the sole criteria for a reduction-in-force, I think there would be a great amount of subjectivity and unfairness because of the system that we have,\" Callahan said. \"I think if the reduction-in-force plan considers several matters including performance, there might be more of a chance for fairness, but frankly, what we're hearing out there is mass reductions at the cheapest possible rate with not a whole lot of care and thought into a reduction-in-force policy.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Clarke County", "latitude": 33.9501, "longitude": -83.3832}, {"name": "Oconee County", "latitude": 33.8335, "longitude": -83.4332}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Jackson", "latitude": 34.1334, "longitude": -83.5666}, {"name": "Barrow", "latitude": 33.9834, "longitude": -83.7166}, {"name": "Barrow County", "latitude": 33.9834, "longitude": -83.7166}, {"name": "Clarke", "latitude": 33.9501, "longitude": -83.3832}, {"name": "Oconee", "latitude": 33.8335, "longitude": -83.4332}, {"name": "Barrow", "latitude": 33.9834, "longitude": -83.7166}, {"name": "Jackson", "latitude": 34.1334, "longitude": -83.5666}, {"name": "Madison", "latitude": 34.1334, "longitude": -83.2165}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Washington", "latitude": 38.8951, "longitude": -77.0364}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

They have got to work with law enforcement for us to be able to prevail and solve this case.\" At the same time, the panelists admitted the difficulties inherent in investigating a nearly 63-year-old case and tried to tamp down expectations. \"We still have some things to do, but I certainly don't want to raise expectations,\" Jones said. However, he said, \"We're not finished, and there are a number of things that we continue to pick up on.\" No matter how gruesome the crime, the rules of evidence still apply, Keenan said. The horrific nature of the lynching of Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, and the national attention it received in the summer of 1946, caused federal officials to put an \"unprecedented amount of pressure\" on FBI agents to solve the case back then, Jones said. Two dozen federal agents swarmed the area, interviewing people and identifying 160 persons of interest. But they ran into a wall of silence from the local community and couldn't put together a case to arrest anyone. Today, the case still is a priority for the FBI and GBI, the panelists said, but they still face a problem with cooperation from people who may know something. \"It's not just a standard cold case homicide,\" said Deitle, whose office is in charge of investigating a number old civil rights era crimes. \"It's also a case where some victims' relatives, witnesses and even some perpetrators are still paralyzed by a climate of fear.\" Of the 107 cold cases the FBI currently is reviewing, the Moore's Ford lynching is the oldest and involves the most victims and alleged perpetrators, Deitle said. There have been a few breaks in the case in recent years, though none appear to have gone anywhere. Last year, FBI and GBI agents executed a search warrant at a house in Walton County's rural Gratis community. After digging in the backyard of the home, agents seized some items and sent them to the GBI's crime lab. Keenan declined to discuss the items seized or any other evidence in the case Saturday because it could inhibit the ongoing investigation. Several years ago, Keenan thought about releasing to the public the GBI's investigative file on Moore's Ford, he said following Saturday's event. He discussed it with the state attorney general, but they decided against it because there still is a chance of prosecution, he said. \"I have seen many cases that we considered to be stagnant that ... there was no activity on and then with a phone call we suddenly piece together a case and go forward with an arrest and prosecution,\" he said. \"That has happened many times in my career so I never believe that a case is hopeless. And I don't believe this one is.\" Saturday's event, sponsored by the Moore's Ford Memorial Committee, also featured a screening of filmmaker Keith Beauchamp's documentary on the killings for the TV One network.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "MONROE", "latitude": 33.7948, "longitude": -83.7132}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Monroe", "latitude": 33.7948, "longitude": -83.7132}, {"name": "Walton County", "latitude": 33.7668, "longitude": -83.7332}, {"name": "Atlanta", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "Walton County", "latitude": 33.7668, "longitude": -83.7332}, {"name": "Moore's Ford", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Walton", "latitude": 33.7668, "longitude": -83.7332}, {"name": "Oconee", "latitude": 33.8335, "longitude": -83.4332}, {"name": "Moore's Ford", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Walton County", "latitude": 33.7668, "longitude": -83.7332}, {"name": "Gratis", "latitude": 33.8826, "longitude": -83.6632}, {"name": "Moore's Ford", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The attorney for a mentally ill man accused of stabbing an Athens-Clarke police officer nearly to death wants another jury to consider whether the defendant is competent to stand trial. Assistant public defender Benjamin Pearlman is arguing that, after a one-day civil trial last fall, a jury contradicted a state psychologist's finding that Steven Anthony Eberhart is incompetent. And, he said, mental health professionals still believe Eberhart isn't sane enough to understand what he did or help in his defense. Pearlman keeps in contact with the staff at East Central Regional Hospital, and every specialist involved in treating Eberhart \"continues to have the opinion that he is still not competent to stand trial,\" Pearlman argued in documents filed last month in Clarke County Superior Court. Pearlman can't defend Eberhart effectively, because his client can't hold a rational conversation about his case, he said. \"It's basically unconstitutional to put a person like that on trial, and it's my responsibility to say that Steven's not in the state of mind to stand trial,\" Pearlman said. \"Even if a jury found he might have been competent before, when someone has mental health issues, their status can change month to month, day to day,\" he said. Authorities say Eberhart, 45, attacked Sgt. Courtney Gale with a kitchen knife on Dec. 11, 2007, repeatedly stabbing the uniformed officer as she worked an off-duty security guard job in the Kroger store on Alps Road. Gale spent two weeks in a coma, had several surgeries to save one of her legs and went through extensive physical and cognitive rehabilitation. A grand jury indicted Eberhart on a criminal attempt to commit murder charge and 10 other felonies, and in September, a civil panel in Clarke County Superior Court determined that Eberhart, though he has a history of schizophrenia, is competent to stand trial. Jurors heard a state Department of Human Resources psychologist testify that Eberhart continued to \"experience psychotic delusions, consistent with his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia,\" according to court documents. Eberhart has been held at the Augusta psychiatric hospital since soon after his arrest in December 2007. He couldn't attend his own arraignment hearing Feb. 4, so the court entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Pearlman filed the request for a second competency trial immediately after the jury finding. Prosecutors are not required to respond, and Superior Court Chief Judge Lawton Stephens has yet to rule on the request. Pearlman already asked the state Court of Appeals to overturn the competency decision, but the court dismissed the appeal in December, stating it lacked jurisdiction. District Attorney Ken Mauldin declined to comment on the request for another competency hearing, other than to say, \"Of course, (Eberhart's) already been found competent by a jury, and they are raising that issue again, saying he's not competent at this time.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Athens", "latitude": 33.9609, "longitude": -83.3779}, {"name": "Clarke", "latitude": 33.9501, "longitude": -83.3832}, {"name": "Clarke County", "latitude": 33.9501, "longitude": -83.3832}, {"name": "Alps Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Clarke County", "latitude": 33.9501, "longitude": -83.3832}, {"name": "Augusta", "latitude": 33.471, "longitude": -81.9748}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

DANIELSVILLE - Madison County commissioners voted Monday to wipe clean the county Board of Tax Assessors by dismissing all four members. The county attorney will draft a letter of dismissal for the assessors laying out the reasons they're being dismissed and letting them know when they can appear before commissioners to tell their side of the story. Monday's vote, which was unanimous, comes after commissioners voted to take away the assessors' power over personnel and after Commission Chairman Anthony Dove requested that all the assessors resign. The tax assessors office and its governing board have been in turmoil for years and failed to finish the county's tax digest on time for nearly a decade. The chronically late digests - compilations of the value of all taxable county property - have caused confusion for taxpayers, who may have to pay two years' worth of taxes in 2009, Dove said at Monday's meeting. \"When you're hired to do a job, if you do not do your job in a week, you're let go - certainly, if you do not do that job in years,\" he said. Dove said he was forced to take action after the assessors recommended only one candidate in four months to fill the long-open job of chief appraiser and after the interim chief offered her resignation this month. Commissioners Stanley Thomas and John Pethel agreed that problems with the assessors had gone on long enough. \"Every section of the county, every taxpayer is concerned about this tax situation,\" Thomas said. Although the assessors board's chairman has promised to bring this year's digest in on time, \"we're further behind now than we have been in the last two or three years,\" Pethel said. \"I don't know how he intends to get the digest out without a chief appraiser.\" Commissioners voted to dismiss the assessors after a brief closed-door session Monday night. Commissioners also said they would vote next month on Dove's recommendation for a new chief appraiser. Before closing the meeting to the public, Commissioner Mike Youngblood pointed out that Board of Assessors Chairman David Ragland has been on the board for only seven months. Assessors Jim Escoe and Larry Stewart, who were appointed by commissioners in August 2005, attended Monday's meeting. Ragland and board Vice Chairwoman Samantha Garland, who was appointed in April 2004, were not there. Escoe said after the meeting he's approached commissioners at least a couple of times to explain the problems in the tax office, but he's been ignored. \"They don't want to know what the problem is,\" he said. \"They think the problem exists in everything.\" The assessors don't plan on backing down by resigning, and Escoe said he would take his case to a judge. \"I relish this; I want this,\" he said. \"Now we can go and get this out in the public.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Madison", "latitude": 34.1334, "longitude": -83.2165}, {"name": "DANIELSVILLE", "latitude": 34.1243, "longitude": -83.2213}, {"name": "Madison County", "latitude": 34.1334, "longitude": -83.2165}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

CORSICANA \u2014 A Henderson County woman was sentenced to 99 years in prison for her role in a mortgage fraud scheme on Monday. On March 17, a Navarro County jury found the defendant, Kandace Yancy Marriott, 52, of Gun Barrel City, guilty of engaging in organized criminal activity. According to prosecutors, evidence presented at the punishment stage showed Marriott received monthly mortgage payments from her clients, failed to remit those payments to the mortgage lender, embezzled the homeowners\u2019 funds, and therefore caused her clients to default on their home loans. Marriott\u2019s conviction stems from her involvement in a complex mortgage fraud scheme that defrauded the federal government. The scheme\u2019s principal operators were the defendant and her husband, Darrell L. Marriott, 54, who sold manufactured homes through their company, One Way Home & Land. However, the defendants\u2019 daughter, Kally Marriott, and Mrs. Marriott\u2019s sister, Karen Hayes, have also been indicted for their role in the scheme. All four defendants face separate charges for related criminal conduct in Kaufman County. According to state investigators, the defendants illegally forged home buyers\u2019 signatures, inaccurately completed loan applications, and falsified supporting documents, including the buyers\u2019 rent payment verification statements, proof of employment, and Social Security Administration benefits data, among other items. Court documents filed by the state indicate that the defendants conduct was intended to ensure that unqualified home buyers loans were approved by mortgage lenders. The scheme involved predominantly low-income purchasers whose residential loans were guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a result, when the unqualified buyers defaulted on their home loans, their mortgage lenders did not suffer financial losses. Instead, HUD \u2014 and therefore the taxpayers \u2014 had to cover the default costs. Investigators believe the defendants\u2019 scheme cost the taxpayers more than $3 million. The defendants closed the One Way Home & Land after litigation and investigations ensued in late 2005. As a result, they opened a Kaufman County firm under the assumed name, Torenia. Additional criminal charges in Kaufman County stem from the defendants\u2019 Torenia operation. The Office of the Attorney General received assistance from the Navarro County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office, Corsicana Police Department and HUD Office of Inspector General. Attorney General Abbott\u2019s Criminal Prosecutions Division is leading the prosecution of the four defendants with the cooperation of district attorneys\u2019 offices in Navarro, Henderson and Ellis counties.

NOTICE: This is the final article in a series that looks back over the past couple of years at the accomplishments of the District 7 Board of Education and ahead to the anticipated challenges it faces. The day-to-day business operations, the working relationships with government entities and officials, and the financing of the school district are all critically important areas and the focus of today\u2019s final article. When in April, 2007, taxpayers approved the $58.3 million referendum to build Albert Cassens Elementary, Goshen Elementary and make major renovations to EHS South and Glen Carbon Elementary, and convert the Alternative School to the new Worden Elementary, the Board of Education made some commitments to taxpayers that Edwardsville District 7 Superintendent Ed Hightower noted as two important financial achievements. \u201cDuring the campaign, the Board of Education made a promise that the tax rate would not change, and as a matter of fact, it dropped slightly,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cThat\u2019s been accomplished.\u201d Hightower pointed out that the second promise the Board of Education had made was that the building bond component of the district\u2019s tax rate would remain consistent for the 20 year term to payoff the $58.3 million. The board assured that the building bond rate would not increase or would be less from the then current rate of approximately .58. The current rate is at approximately .54 which Hightower noted as a second achievement. Hightower emphasized that the bond rate was at this lower rate due to conservative planning in regards to estimating the Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV). The State of Illinois\u2019 Web site defines the EAV as \u201cthe result of applying the state equalization factor to the assessed value of a parcel of property. Tax bills are then calculated by multiplying the EAV (after any deductions for homesteads) by the tax rate.\u201d Although the district had seen EAV growth rates averaging between 11 and 12 percent, the board estimated a rate much lower to be conservative. The EAV growth rate is estimated at 8.5 percent for the 2008 levy but future years will be even lower. \u201cThe 2009 levy for the 2010-11 fiscal year will be at 7 percent and continue thereafter for the life of the bonds,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty conservative. That\u2019s all built in.\u201d \u201cWhen we set the 20 year issue up, we tried to be conservative,\u201d Assistant Superintendent of Business Operations Dave Courtney said. \u201cAfter the first couple of years, we had done an estimate on EAV that was at 7 percent rather than the 10, 11, 12, 13 percent that we were seeing before.\u201d Courtney noted that by using the 7 percent figure \u201cwe were able to maintain a consistent rate on the entire 20 year term.\u201d While speaking about financing, the topic of the district\u2019s loss of revenue arose. When asked about the $1.5 million loss of revenue to the school district as the result of TIFs (Tax Increment Financing) as suggested by mayoral candidate Wesley Tippit in his door-to-door campaigning, Hightower emphatically responded, \u201cLet me just say that. . . it is misleading and it is totally inaccurate. It\u2019s nowhere near $1.5 million dollars.\u201d The City of Edwardsville currently has three TIF districts: TIF I and TIF II in the downtown area, and TIF III at Gateway Commerce Center. The Edwardsville City Council approved in 2008 a fourth TIF plan for an area in downtown Edwardsville from the intersection of East College to the intersection of Illinois Route 159 and Old Alton Edwardsville Road. To illustrate his point, Hightower went on to explain that Courtney estimated a loss of only $66,000 for TIF I and about $54,000 for TIF II. In addition, Courtney provided estimates of losses to TIF III at approximately $127,000 and TIF IV is currently at about $3,000. Hightower also felt the TIFs provided numerous benefits. \u201cWhen you look at what has happened there (downtown) in the last 20 years,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cLook at the development, look at the number of improvements that have been made and the number of people employed. That is adding a benefit to this community.\u201d \u201cIt is so unfair that the school district would be used in this type of a campaign \u2013 it\u2019s untrue,\" Hightower said. \" When you consider all of the improvements that have been made and you ask yourself the question, \u2018Has the quality of life improved? Has economic development improved in this area?\u2019 The answer would be yes.\u201d Another accomplishment of the board was its role in the construction of Governors\u2019 Parkway from 157 to District Drive and Glen Crossing Road in Glen Carbon. Hightower stated that extending Governors\u2019 Parkway allowed 30 to 35 percent of the traffic to be diverted off of Goshen Road in addition to providing Vicksburg residents with another exit onto Governors\u2019 Parkway. He said that the new road allowed for a reduction in bus transportation in that area which was a savings to the district and that the new road improves traffic flow throughout the city of Edwardsville. He also noted that the completed extension would soon allow for travel from 157 all the way to 143 near the Interstate 55 entrance ramp. Hightower attributed the success of this project to a collaboration of many key individuals. \u201cMayor Gary Niebur has done an incredible job of leading and working collaboratively with the school district and Representative Jay Hoffman in getting the millions of dollars to complete Governors\u2019 Parkway from 157 all the way to 143,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cWithout collaboration, without working together, this could not have been done, and a great deal of credit goes to Mayor Gary Niebur and city officials for their hard work in getting this done.\u201d According to Hightower, the same group effort occurred in Glen Carbon in getting Glen Crossing complete. \u201cWe were able to work collaboratively with Mayor Jackstadt, the village trustees and Representative Hoffman was able to bring that money to the area,\u201d he said. Noting that phase one of the project had been in the Village of Glen Carbon\u2019s budget, but phase two was not, Hightower added that, \u201cIf Goshen Elementary School, if Cassens Elementary School would not have been part of the two road construction projects, that money would not have been filtered to this area as expeditiously as it was.\u201d Looking ahead at the challenges the Board of Education will face in the next two years, Hightower said that the major challenge is \u201cthe uncertainty at the state level and the impact that the national economy is having.\u201d \u201cThe number two challenge will be, financially, that we keep focus, live within our means, and not be tempted to use our reserves as our primary bridge for funding day to day operations of the school district,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must continue to hold the line, be fiscally responsible and do everything that we can to not impact student learning.\u201d He further stated that the goals would be \u201dkeeping class sizes where they are currently, not cutting teachers, keeping employees to the extent that we can, intact, and maintaining a three-year financial plan that will guide and lead the district without having to use our reserves \u2013 other than for the unanticipated occurrences that happens in the district.\u201d Should the district be fortunate and receive stimulus funds, Hightower said that the district will be in a more stabilized position. But he also stressed that the current budget reductions to increase revenues were \u201cnot anything that any other responsible entity around the country should be doing at this time.\u201d \u201cWe have an obligation and a responsibility of running the district like it\u2019s a business with an understanding that we have an obligation to educate our students, and that we will do,\u201d Hightower said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Glen Carbon", "latitude": 38.7484, "longitude": -89.9832}, {"name": "Edwardsville", "latitude": 38.8114, "longitude": -89.9532}, {"name": "Illinois", "latitude": 40.0003, "longitude": -89.2504}, {"name": "Edwardsville", "latitude": 38.8114, "longitude": -89.9532}, {"name": "Edwardsville", "latitude": 38.8114, "longitude": -89.9532}, {"name": "Edwardsville", "latitude": 38.8114, "longitude": -89.9532}, {"name": "Illinois Route 159", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Old Alton Edwardsville Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Governors\u2019 Parkway", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "District Drive", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Glen Crossing Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Glen Carbon", "latitude": 38.7484, "longitude": -89.9832}, {"name": "Governors\u2019 Parkway", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Goshen Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Vicksburg", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Governors\u2019 Parkway", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Edwardsville", "latitude": 38.8114, "longitude": -89.9532}, {"name": "Governors\u2019 Parkway", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Glen Carbon", "latitude": 38.7484, "longitude": -89.9832}, {"name": "Glen Carbon", "latitude": 38.7484, "longitude": -89.9832}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

It began like an ordinary Sunday worship service, but at First Baptist Church Maryville, it wasn\u2019t an ordinary Sunday. It was the first worship service in the large sanctuary since their pastor, The Rev. Dr. Fred Winters, was killed there last Sunday. The Rev. Al Meredith, senior pastor of Wedgewood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, brought a message of hope to the congregation in Maryville in three services Sunday morning. Ten years ago, a gunman entered his church in Fort Worth and killed seven people and wounded several others. Meredith escaped harm. The differences in the church shootings, Meredith noted, were in the number killed and the fact that the one killed in Maryville was the shepherd of the flock. \u201cIf this church is going to make it, it will be by the grace of God,\u201d Meredith repeated the message he gave in interviews this week. \u201cIsaiah said, \u2018Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter. \u2019\u201dTo prevent this happening to the Maryville church, he told members Sunday, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step up to the plate.\u201d The world is searching for hope, he said. He told of the Russian submarine tragedy when several members of the crew survived at the bottom of the sea until their oxygen ran out. Divers, who heard tapping when they reached the sub, interpreted the Morse code: \u201cIs there any hope?\u201d All of the sailors aboard the sunken submarine perished. He said as Winston Churchill lay dying, he met for a few minutes with The Rev. Billy Graham and his question for the evangelist was, \u201cIs there any hope?\u201d Graham would have told him of the heavenly hope. Meredith said he left his church in Fort Worth with the blessing of his congregation to bring the message to Maryville and to the world, \u201cIn Jesus Christ there is hope.\u201d He named several of the ones who were slain at the Fort Worth church a decade ago and told the story of Jeremiah, a young man who may have stopped the slaughter. He called the young man a \u201cbaby Christian,\u201d who faced the gunman and said, \u201cYou need Jesus Christ in your life.\u201d As the gunman turned on him, Jeremiah spread his arms and said, \u201cGo ahead \u2013 shoot me. I know where I\u2019m going \u2013 do you? Whereupon, the gunman slumped into one of the seats and turned his gun on himself. \u201cYou are what you are under pressure,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cWhat do you get when you squeeze an orange?\u201d He nodded in agreement with the response, \u201cOrange juice,\u201d and added, \u201cYou don\u2019t get Dr. Pepper.\u201d He told the congregation that they will never get over the shooting of their pastor, but they will get through it. Meredith said a church secretary lived across from the church, but wasn\u2019t at the scene of the shooting. Her husband, a law enforcement officer put out a call for all police available to go to the church, but by the time they arrived it was over. He later told Meredith that when he went into the church and saw the carnage and the spilled blood, he smelled the cordite from the bullets yet he could feel the presence of God. Later, as the investigation began, he went into the church and wondered if he had imagined that presence. He asked for a sign that he had felt the presence of God. The investigation turned up a hymnal that had stopped a bullet. \u201cThe bullet stopped at the page with the \u2018Hallelujah Chorus,\u2019\u201d Meredith said. \u201cIt pointed to the words, \u2018King of kings, Lord of lords \u2013 and he shall reign forever and ever,\u2019 and he was convinced.\u201d Meredith chose Romans 15:13 as his text Sunday. \u201cNow the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.\u201d Meredith said the verse promises hope now that everyone can receive through believing. Meredith often breaks into song during his sermons and he asked the congregation to join him in singing, \u201cIt is Well with My Soul.\u201d Mindful that the man who killed Dr. Winters approached the pulpit down the center aisle, Meredith didn\u2019t hesitate to give the invitation to those wishing to accept Jesus as savior, to come down the aisle toward him and several did.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Maryville", "latitude": 38.7237, "longitude": -89.9559}, {"name": "Maryville", "latitude": 38.7237, "longitude": -89.9559}, {"name": "Fort Worth", "latitude": 32.7254, "longitude": -97.3208}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Maryville", "latitude": 38.7237, "longitude": -89.9559}, {"name": "Fort Worth", "latitude": 32.7254, "longitude": -97.3208}, {"name": "Maryville", "latitude": 38.7237, "longitude": -89.9559}, {"name": "Maryville", "latitude": 38.7237, "longitude": -89.9559}, {"name": "Fort Worth", "latitude": 32.7254, "longitude": -97.3208}, {"name": "Maryville", "latitude": 38.7237, "longitude": -89.9559}, {"name": "Fort Worth", "latitude": 32.7254, "longitude": -97.3208}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

St. Patrick's Day is a time for fun and celebration, but it can also turn tragic when drinking and driving are involved. The Madison County Health Department and Madison County Partnership for Community Health Motor Vehicle Committee are reminding those who do choose to drink to do so responsibly by designating a sober driver before the party begins. \u201cStatistics from the National Highway Traffic Administration show that over the past five years, 851 people lost their lives in motor vehicle crashes during the St. Patrick\u2019s Day holiday. Out of that number, 327 were killed in crashes that involved a drunk driver with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or higher,\u201d a statement from the department says. MCHD Health Educator Jill Heuchert said the annual event is supposed to be a time to celebrate Irish heritage and to gather with friends, but that it can quickly turn deadly when alcohol is involved. \u201cIf you plan on drinking, don\u2019t rely on luck to keep you safe or to keep your out of trouble. Be responsible and take appropriate precautions,\u201d Heuchert said. The department offers these tips for party goers: Avoid drinking too much alcohol too fast. Pace yourself. Alternate with non-alcoholic drinks. Designate a sober driver before the party begins. Give that person your car keys. If you are impaired, don\u2019t even consider driving. Ask a sober friend, call a cab, or stay where you are and sleep it off. Take the impaired person\u2019s keys and never let a friend leave your sight if you think they are about to drive while under the influence. For those hosting a party: Serve lots of food, particularly high-protein dishes, and be sure to include lots of non-alcoholic beverages. Stop serving alcohol at the end of the early in the evening and begin serving coffee and dessert. Be sure all of your guests designate their drivers in advance, or help arrange ride-sharing with sober drivers. Keep the numbers for local cab companies handy and take the keys away from anyone who is thinking of driving while impaired. Never serve alcoholic beverages to individuals under 21 years of age.

ATLANTA - A former assisted suicide network leader being prosecuted in a Georgia man's death is defending his group's practice of guiding people who want to kill themselves because they're suffering but not necessarily dying. At least three of the people known to have commited suicide through the Final Exit Network were not terminally ill. In his most extensive remarks since his arrest last month, Ted Goodwin told The Associated Press Tuesday that people with just months to live aren't the only ones who should be able to seek help committing suicide. \"These people who are terminally ill are blessed in a small way - there's a finite time for their suffering,\" said Goodwin, who stepped down as president of the network after his arrest. \"But there are many, many people who are doomed to suffer interminably for years. And why should they not receive our support as well?\" Critics within the right-to-die movement, including Dr. Jack Kevorkian, say people should be able to seek assistance ending their lives, but only from doctors and only if they're terminally ill. Georgia authorities say John Celmer, the 58-year-old man whose suicide led to charges against Goodwin and three others, was making a remarkable recovery from cancer when the group sent exit guides to his home to show him how to suffocate himself using helium tanks and a plastic hood. And police say that in 2007, the group helped an Arizona woman named Jana Van Voorhis who was depressed but not terminally ill. The third person, Kurt Perry, a suburban Chicago resident who was to have been the group's next suicide, has a debilitating neurological condition that is painful but usually not fatal. The 26-year-old said frightening breathing lapses prompted him to seek support from the network. \"Having them there with me would be a blessing and an honor,\" he said in an interview Tuesday. He was set to die Feb. 26, one day after Goodwin and the others were charged with violating Georgia's assisted suicide law. But he has since changed his mind, saying the arrests have given him new reason to live and help the group with its work. The network has drawn criticism from those who worry it isn't screening those who want to die carefully enough. \"You want to be sure before anyone is going to do anything like this that they're getting the best possible end-of-life care,\" said Dr. Timothy Quill, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and a supporter of Oregon and Washington laws that allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their lives. Goodwin, who is not a physician and founded the group in 2004 after his father died of emphysema, says the network helped guide nearly 200 people across the country die to but never actively assisted suicide. He says he was personally involved in 39 deaths. The arrests were the result of an eight-month investigation in which an undercover agent posing as someone bent on suicide infiltrated the group, which bases its work on \"The Final Exit,\" a best-selling suicide manual by British author Derek Humphry. Goodwin would not comment on the suicide process, but disputed Georgia authorities' contention that guides held down members' hands to prevent them from removing the hoods they placed over their heads while they breathed helium. \"We do not hold hands down. We do not cause them to suffer,\" he said. \"And this will be proven in a court of law - I promise you.\" Authorities have also questioned how carefully the group, which claims 3,300 members and donors and about 100 volunteers, screened people who want to commit suicide. Goodwin says the vetting process was tightened in 2007, after questions about Van Voorhis' death. Goodwin defended the group's involvement, saying Van Voorhis suffered from other illnesses, but people who sought help after her were asked to detail their complete mental history. About 30 percent of the applications the group received each year were from mentally ill people who wanted to die because of a lost job, lost spouse or other anguish. Those applications were immediately set aside, Goodwin said. If an applicant's mental history raised a concern, which happened occasionally, one of 10 psychiatrists or psychologists working with the group visited to assess the situation. But if it didn't, Goodwin said, the applicant got help, even though the group knew its work could one day lead to prosecution. \"We believe that it is the right of every mentally competent adult to determine whether he or she is suffering,\" Goodwin said. \"We do not believe this should be left to the physicians, church leaders or politicians. This is the right of every mentally competent individual to make this decision themselves.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "ATLANTA", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Arizona", "latitude": 34.5003, "longitude": -111.501}, {"name": "Chicago", "latitude": 41.85, "longitude": -87.6501}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Rochester", "latitude": 43.1548, "longitude": -77.6156}, {"name": "Oregon", "latitude": 44.0001, "longitude": -120.501}, {"name": "Washington", "latitude": 47.5001, "longitude": -120.501}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

COLUMBIA --- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Friday he won't spend $700 million in federal stimulus cash, an announcement unlikely to affect whether the state gets the money and one that came after the Republican was twice rebuffed by the White House in his attempts to use the cash to pay off state debt. \"We're obviously disappointed by the White House's decision, because it cuts against the notion of federalism and the idea of each state having the flexibility to act in a manner that best suits its needs,\" Mr. Sanford said. \"As a result, we will not be seeking the use of these federal funds for the way they put our state even further into an unconscionable level of debt.\" Mr. Sanford has become a prominent voice in opposing federal bailouts. He contends that stimulus money won't increase employment and will merely add to federal debt that will lead to higher taxes. On Thursday, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she would reject nearly a third of an estimated $930 million that could flow to her state. Mr. Sanford, who is in Nevada for Air Force Reserve training, released a statement about an hour after White House budget chief Peter Orszag denied his request to use a portion of federal stimulus money to pay off school construction debt. Mr. Orszag sent Mr. Sanford a letter Friday saying the money can't be used on debt payments and instead needs to restore funding cuts from state budgets and help aid schools. One of the goals of the $787 billion stimulus package is \"to make critical investments in long-term economic growth, such as providing every child the chance for a world-class education,\" Mr. Orszag wrote. In all, South Carolina is to get about $2.8 billion in federal stimulus money over two years. The state's mayors had implored Mr. Sanford to take all the money he could, and the Republican-dominated Legislature has already made plans to spend the portion the governor balked on. In January, South Carolina had the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation and officials had to cut $1 billion from a $7 billion budget as the recession dampened revenue collections. The House last week passed a $6.6 billion budget patched together with $1 billion in stimulus cash. Mr. Sanford's anti-bailout stance was one of the things that led House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., to insert language into the bill allowing state legislators to override governors, a move that has raised constitutional concerns. Mr. Clyburn disagrees. \"For one, nobody is sidestepping the governor. The governor is taking himself out of the game,\" Mr. Clyburn said. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, said taking the money over Mr. Sanford's objections raises the likelihood of a lawsuit that would delay the state's ability to use it.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "COLUMBIA", "latitude": 34.0007, "longitude": -81.0348}, {"name": "South Carolina", "latitude": 34.0004, "longitude": -81.0001}, {"name": "Alaska", "latitude": 64.0003, "longitude": -150.0}, {"name": "Nevada", "latitude": 39.2502, "longitude": -116.751}, {"name": "South Carolina", "latitude": 34.0004, "longitude": -81.0001}, {"name": "South Carolina", "latitude": 34.0004, "longitude": -81.0001}, {"name": "S.C.", "latitude": 34.0004, "longitude": -81.0001}, {"name": "Florence", "latitude": 34.1954, "longitude": -79.7626}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The wounding of a Columbia County woman charged in the beating death of a neighbor was staged to distract law enforcement, Richmond County investigators said Monday. Sheriff's Lt. Scott Peebles also said his department plans to submit its evidence to the district attorney for possible indictment. Authorities said Rebecca Sears, 41, of Grovetown, planned to have her son, Christopher Sean Bowers, 19, of Martinez, threaten her with a gun Thursday night as she left her job at Healing Hands Physical Therapy on Augusta's Highland Avenue. Ms. Sears was supposed to be on the phone with a co-worker at the time, according to sheriff's Sgt. Blaise Dresser. Instead, the son fired the gun, wounding his mother in the leg, Sgt. Dresser said. Ms. Sears told police a strange man appeared from the bushes as she left work, shot her in the leg, then said if she \"didn't have his money it would be her face,\" according to a Richmond County sheriff's report. \"She wasn't real happy about getting shot,\" Sgt. Dresser said Monday. Ms. Sears and Mr. Bowers are now both charged with murder in the brutal beating of Katherine \"Kay\" Parsons, 41, who was Ms. Sears' neighbor on Hot Springs Drive, as well as a co-worker. Last week, authorities said Mrs. Parsons appeared to have interrupted a burglary at her home, but sources familiar with the investigation said they now believe burglary was not a motive in her death. So far police have refused to discuss what prompted the fatal beating.

According to arrest warrants filed with the court, authorities allege that Ms. Sears and Mr. Bowers killed Mrs. Parsons between 6:50 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. Wednesday after she returned home from taking her son to school. A deputy was called to her home when a contractor discovered a smashed-in door, and found Mrs. Parsons lying in the garage near a baseball bat and claw hammer believed to have been used in the attack.

Grovetown police then questioned Ms. Odell, who admitted that she willingly drove Mr. Grier to Alabama. She also told police that she drove the getaway car for Mr. Grier as he conducted the robbery and disposed of the gun he used, Investigator Wheatley said.

ATLANTA - Regional 2-1-1, a dialing code linking needy Georgia residents with everything from food pantries to social services, could begin expanding statewide by the end of the year, United Way officials said. If approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, the expansion would stretch the service to 69 currently unserved counties. Those include several rural counties, among the hardest-hit by foreclosure and unemployment in the state. \"You want folks to be able to have access to information that helps them address basic needs - and you want them to be able to access that information wherever they live in the state,\" said Milton J. Little Jr., president of United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, which initiated the exchange in 1997 and is leading efforts to expand statewide. United Way officials hope to submit a proposal to the commission by the end of the year. Right now, 2-1-1 callers are connected with operators at one of 11 call centers serving metropolitan regions across the state. Callers explain their needs to operators - anything from shelter after a weather catastrophe to rental assistance - who refer them to area service agencies. Organizers say the idea is to help people navigate the complex and ever-growing network of programs. It helps the needy in the most heavily populated areas of Georgia. But United Way officials have lacked the funds to expand to farther-flung areas, Little said. For them, \"resources as critical as emergency financial help to as general as where do I find a place to send my aging parents - they just don't have access,\" Little said. Expansion plans coincide with an increase in calls to the line. Operators fielded more than 370,000 calls in 2008, up from more than 336,000 in 2007. Little said some calls this time last year were for post-tornado help in the region. \"A lot of those callers now are bringing up issues related to food, clothing and shelter,\" said Little, who recently estimated 41.5 percent of Atlanta-area calls are for help with day-to-day expenses. Other states have been pushing to expand the program which United Way estimates connects 234 million people with social services. There are 29 states with full coverage, according to Linda Daily, director for 2-1-1 at United Way of America. They include Texas, where state funds cover 80 percent of the program's budget, she said. But many states are grappling with heavy shortfalls, and Daily acknowledged funding 2-1-1 could be a challenge. \"The budget is the main hurdle,\" she said, adding national United Way officials have lobbied Congress for help nationalizing the 2-1-1 program. Pending federal legislation could set aside $150 million in state 2-1-1 grant money for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and $100 million for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Versions of the bill are in committee in both the House and Senate. In Georgia, a coalition of United Way agencies led by the Atlanta agency will draft a plan that outlines how to fund the expansion, including possible use of state money. It will have to be approved by the commission and later, state lawmakers.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "ATLANTA", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Atlanta", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Atlanta", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "America", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Atlanta", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

ATLANTA - A former mega church leader who rose to fame with his progressive evangelical ministry only to have it crumble after a series of sex scandals will be honored in the church he helped build in suburban Atlanta. Archbishop Earl Paulk of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill Harvester Church died Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 81. A funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Cathedral in Decatur. For years the church was at the forefront of many social movements - admitting black members in the 1960s, ordaining women and opening its doors to gays. But Paulk was dogged for decades by accusations of molestation and sexual misconduct. The most shocking revelation came in October 2007 when a court-ordered paternity test showed he was the biological father of his brother's son, D.E. Paulk, who had become head pastor of the church after the archbishop retired the previous year. Earl Paulk had sworn in an affidavit he'd never had sex with anyone but his wife, which lead to him pleading guilty to a felony charge of lying under oath. He was sentenced to 10 years' probation and a $1,000 fine. None of the Paulks could be reached for comment by The Associated Press, but D.E. Paulk issued a statement. \"Over the past 55 years, Bishop Paulk has ministered to thousands in the Atlanta area and touched the lives of countless thousands in the global community,\" he wrote. \"As the family and church mourn his death and celebrate his life, we pray for peace and closure for all who have been connected in any way to his life and ministry.\" Paulk's church, which he co-founded with his brother, Don, grew from a tiny congregation in the 1960s to a massive empire with 10,000 members, an international television ministry, a Bible college and a $12 million sanctuary on an expansive 100-acre plot in Decatur. Paulk was invited to a White House prayer breakfast by then-President Ronald Reagan, and the church was named one of former President George Bush's \"1,000 Points of Light.\" The church made national headlines in 1992 when six female members came forward saying they were brainwashed into having sexual relationships with Earl Paulk and Don Paulk and other ministers at the church. A decade later, a former church member accused Earl Paulk of molesting her when she was a child and teenager, a lawsuit that eventually was settled out of court. Then former church employee Mona Brewer sued Earl Paulk and the church, saying she had been coerced into having a long-term affair with the pastor because he told her it was her godly duty. It was her lawsuit that led to the paternity test and the felony charge. At the same time, Earl Paulk was battling prostate cancer and undergoing multiple surgeries that left him weak and unable to make much more than one appearance at the church each week. The church's membership dwindled to 1,000 - mostly due to the sexual scandals - and the flashy neo-Gothic cathedral is up for sale for $24.5 million. The church is seeking to move to a smaller venue and continue its ministry, D.E. Paulk has said. Don Paulk told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he hopes his brother will be remembered for his work in ministry rather than the scandals. \"Preachers are just like anyone else - they're a man,\" he told the newspaper.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ga.", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "ATLANTA", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "Atlanta", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "Decatur", "latitude": 33.7748, "longitude": -84.2963}, {"name": "Atlanta", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}, {"name": "Decatur", "latitude": 39.8403, "longitude": -88.9548}, {"name": "Atlanta", "latitude": 33.749, "longitude": -84.388}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

FALLS VILLAGE\u2014The Region 1 Board of Education moved quickly at its Monday night meeting to approve a proposed budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year reflecting a 1.99 percent increase in spending, a decision precipitated by several revisions and budgetary workshops. However, several members of the public took issue with the budget\u2019s elimination of a custodial position and scheduling adjustment for the custodial staff. \u201cA lot of you people just don\u2019t realize what goes on in this building on a day-to-day basis,\u201d said Pete Peterson. The budget removes one position from the daytime staff of two and a half positions and transfers one of the former daytime custodians to the night shift for a total of five staff members focusing on cleaning. Peterson, who fills the half position during the day, outlined his routine responsibilities, which include cleaning the locker rooms, kitchen and cafeteria, along with performing athletic field maintenance, in addition to emergencies and repairs. On Monday, when one of the hallways flooded, Mr. Peterson was forced to tend to the situation. He stressed that if the same situation were to occur with only two custodians in the building, certain responsibilities, such as lining the fields, would fall through the cracks. With spring clean close at hand and fall cleanup looming in the future, paring down the daytime staffing creates a daunting picture for Peterson. \u201cI understand the fiscal ramifications of a budget, but I think the personnel aspect is overlooked,\u201d said Mary Wheeler, a teacher whose husband is a custodian. Speaking on behalf of her husband, who also spoke at the meeting, she explained that her family relies on the dynamic of two parents being at home during the evening hours. Wheeler is set to move from the daytime shift to working from 3 to 11 p.m. As a teacher, Wheeler recognized the board\u2019s duty to the taxpayers, but she emphasized the unfairness of significantly altering a 17-year employee\u2019s schedule without consulting him. Though the board approved the budget with a majority vote, member Gale Toensing voiced her concern with the cuts and changes to the custodial staff. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into this doing more with less,\u201d she said. She added that the board could not ignore what she characterized as substantial objections from the members of the community to the proposed reductions. The 1.99 percent increase brings the budget\u2019s total to $14,149,238. Business Manager Sam Herrick continues to negotiate for a lower health care insurance renewal rate with Anthem Blue Cross, which produced the largest increase in the budget due last year\u2019s high claim rate. The current rate is 23.63 percent higher. Board chairman Judge Manning also reported on the recent Personnel Committee\u2019s \u201creluctant acceptance\u201d of a salary freeze for Superintendent Patricia Chamberlain, per her request. During the budget process, both Herrick and high school principal Gretchen Foster also offered to forego their raises. However, Chamberlain vetoed that suggestion. With the proposed budget set, member towns\u2019 contributions to Region 1 will be impacted in various degrees. Only Cornwall and Kent will see decreases, of $119,624 and $42,474 for a total of $1,409,257 and $2,552,999, respectively. Canaan will experience the highest jump, of $223,569, to a total of $3,440,885. Salisbury will face the second largest increase, of $138,429, for a total of $3,040,398. Sharon and Falls Village would see increases of $40,995 and $35,377, for totals of $2,718,708 and $986,989, respectively. Manning and Herrick visited residents in Sharon, Cornwall and Salisbury, members of Kent\u2019s Board of Finance attended previous workshops and a meeting with the Canaan Board of Finance is scheduled for this week, thus ensuring that the Region 1 Board reviews the 1.99 percent increase directly with the member towns. Manning reported the budget has been positively received. Peterson, however, retained his doubts after the vote. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting us way, way short,\u201d he said.

HARTFORD \u2014 Connecticut legislators are considering making their state the first in New England to apologize for slavery and other racist policies of old. A legislative committee heard testimony Monday on a resolution that would issue a formal, general apology and express the General Assembly's \"profound contrition\" for the official acts that sanctioned and perpetuated slavery hundreds of years ago. The state's African-American Affairs Commission, a liaison between black communities and the government, is urging legislators to pass the resolution, which it has called \"an exercise in reconciliation\" and not an effort to determine fault for slavery. The commission's legislative analyst, Frank Sykes, told the legislature's Government Administration and Elections Committee that \"opportunities like this must be seized,\" especially in light of the \"giant stride\" the country took last November in electing its first black president, Barack Obama. \"While this is encouraging,\" Sykes said, \"it should inspire us and challenge us to continue peeling away at the layers of racial discrimination and intolerance. \"New Jersey last year became the first Northern state to apologize for slavery, and at least five other states have done so. Of Connecticut's population of 3.5 million people, about 10 percent are black, according to U.S. Census estimates for 2007. John A. Stewart, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Hartford, said he believes the differences between blacks and whites in the state stem from Connecticut's participation in slavery. Among full-time workers in the state, black men earn 70 percent of what white men earn. Black men in the state also are four times more likely than white men to live below the federal poverty line, and black children under 5 are seven times more likely than white children to live in poverty, Stewart said, citing U.S. Census data. \"Slavery has left a cultural burden on both the exploited and the exploiters that still permeates our society,\" Stewart said. The resolution says slavery was practiced in Connecticut from the 17th through 19th centuries. There were about 5,100 slaves in the colony by the mid-1770s, about 3 percent of the population at the time. In 1723, the colony passed an act creating a 9 p.m. curfew for slaves to prevent what it called the \"Disorder of Negro and Indian Servants and Slaves in the Night Season.\" Violation of the curfew was punishable by a whipping for the servant and a fine for the master. The resolution mentions how Connecticut's wealth grew as merchants participated in the Triangle Trade, which carried slaves, crops and goods among West Africa, the Caribbean and America. It also mentions how Connecticut legislators rejected emancipation bills in 1777, 1779 and 1780 and how the new state Constitution in 1818 specifically denied the right of blacks to vote. But it later mentions how Connecticut changed its ways and played a key role in abolition efforts, culminating in the outlawing of slavery in 1848. The resolution would need to be voted on by the Government Administration and Elections Committee, possibly next week, before going to the House of Representatives and then the Senate.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "HARTFORD", "latitude": 41.7637, "longitude": -72.6851}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "New England", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "New Jersey", "latitude": 40.1671, "longitude": -74.4999}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Hartford", "latitude": 41.7637, "longitude": -72.6851}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "Africa", "latitude": 7.1881, "longitude": 21.0938}, {"name": "Caribbean", "latitude": 15.0, "longitude": -75.0}, {"name": "America", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

TORRINGTON \u2014 A fire destroyed the roof of a Main Street multi-family home Tuesday, displacing the tenants and injuring some firefighters. No residents were injured. The Torrington Fire Department responded to the call of a kitchen fire around 12:30 p.m. at 775 Main St., near the intersection of Dawes Street. What initially appeared under control progressively worsened, beginning with some smoke and resulting in flames and full-brown clouds emerging from the house, officials said. A total of 18 people live in the six-apartment building, and all evacuated safely, building owner Buzz Ebner said. Firefighters battled the incident throughout the entire afternoon and were on the scene as late as 10:30 p.m. Fire Marshal Tim Tharau said the department continued to put water on the structure after 8 p.m.A rehab station was set up outside of the house for firefighters to recuperate and check their blood pressure, said Litchfield Fire Chief Jim Koser. A few firefighters sustained minor injuries, but nothing too major occurred, Tharau said. An investigation determined that the incident began in the second-floor area of the building and was caused by a kitchen stove fire, Tharau said. The fire was accidental, he said. The building separates a north and south wing through a thick concrete wall in the middle, Ebner said. Emergency access staircases are both in the back and the front, he said. The initial blaze could be seen from the sides and the rear of the house, on both the second- and third-floor levels. A cloud of brown smoke emerged in full droves and encapsulated the entire north end of the city for hours. By 6 p.m., the entire roof of the home collapsed and water was flowing down the sides of the house. Torrington firefighters called in several other companies to assist including Harwinton, Bantam, Litchfield, Winsted and all Torrington volunteer departments. Several fire engines came and went during the incident and emergency medical services, city police and hazardous material trucks were also on the scene. Residents walked down from as far as the local McDonald\u2019s to witness the commotion. During several points throughout the day spectators stopped to take pictures and watch as firefighters descended into a blaze of smoke on top of the roof. Some even watched from across the Naugatuck River in the Shop Rite parking lot. Jay Keefe, who lives down the street, said he heard the sirens of the trucks come by. When he looked out his window, he saw the smoke emerge from the three-story home. Due to the increasing smoke and the need to bring in more assistance, police and firefighters continuously pushed back the large mass of spectators, placing yellow caution tape along the side roads. At points traffic was detoured from as far down as Lois Street and nearby pedestrians were prohibited from getting too close to the action. Following the devastation, Red Cross in Waterbury provided shelter for the residents of the house, Ebner said. The building was equipped with fire insurance and some of the residents had fire insurance as part of their rent package, he said. Evan Heller, assistant fire weather program leader for the Albany-based National Weather Service, said the weather conditions on Tuesday had fire hazard potential \u2014 particularly the dry air and low humidity. \u201cWind is a factor,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThe stronger the wind the higher the potential.\u201d The early spring is considered \u201cfire weather season,\u201d he said, after the snow melts but before the leaves begin to grow again. \u201cThis is the time that things can dry out,\u201d Heller said. \u201cUsually once you leaf out, by early summer, usually that risk tends to go down.\u201d Several other fires occurred throughout the state Tuesday, including a brush fire on Center Street in Torrington, fires in Weston and a forest fire in Glastonbury.

Shortly after 7 a.m., police received a complaint from a tenant about loud music, which \u201cwas disrupting his peace,\u201d coming from another apartment, Capt. Roy A. Nelson said. An officer responded and \u201che could hear the music from a couple of houses away,\u201d Nelson said. However, when the officer went to the apartment from where the music was coming, Nelson said the tenant, Brian O\u2019Connor, 38, of 20E Nordland Ave., \u201cwas cooperative and agreed to turn down the music.\u201d With that, the officer left, the captain said. But at 8:12 a.m., police were summoned back to the same address by a frantic call from a frightened tenant of the building. The woman told police that O\u2019Connor had threatened her and had damaged her property \u2014 and that he had come into her apartment without being invited in. When police, including Sgt. Edwin Kosinski, arrived at the address in response to the call, they were told O\u2019Connor had allegedly gone to another tenant\u2019s apartment first. He banged on the door and allegedly accused the first tenant of having called police, Nelson said. However, that tenant was apparently able to convince O\u2019Connor he had not called the police. So, police said, O\u2019Connor moved on to another apartment. There, he allegedly damaged the woman\u2019s wind chime and then \u201cmade entry into her apartment.\u201d Once inside, he allegedly called out, threatening the woman, police said. Frightened, \u201cthe woman hid until Mr. O\u2019Connor left and then called police,\u201d Nelson said. As police proceeded with their investigation, Sgt. Kosinski stopped a tenant and asked him if he was Brian O\u2019Connor. The man replied he was not, at which point he began advancing on Kosinski, Nelson said. However, Officer Joe DiMaruo, who knew O\u2019Connor, alerted Kosinski that the man he had questioned and who approached him was in fact O\u2019Connor. Kosinski ordered the man to back away, and when he would not, Nelson said Kosinski subdued him with minimal force.

CAMBRIDGE'S Mr Ice Cream, Antonio Savino, has died. Mr Savino, who was 72, was a familiar, cheerful face on the city's streets for 40 years, selling ice cream from his van on Chesterton Road, along the Backs, and at Cherry Hinton Hall. As he drove around, his van would chime the tune O Sole Mio, and his beaming smile will be remembered by thousands of people. He was born in the small village of Flumeri in southern Italy in 1936, and married the love of his life, Antonietta, in 1958. She had been living in England for four years, and the couple were both employed as domestics for a wealthy family at Kentford, near Newmarket. Later they moved to Cambridge and Mr Savino got a job at the Fitzwilliam Museum, also working as a kitchen porter. Being a tailor by trade, he took in work making and repairing suits for the Cambridge Italian community. In 1967, having saved enough money, he bought his first ice cream van and became one of the first vendors in Cambridge. In the early days his round would cover much of north Cambridge, including Arbury and Chesterton, then during the 1980s he was given a permit by the city council to have a fixed pitch at Garret Hostel Lane, along the Backs. A family spokeswoman said: \"Locals and tourists will have lovely memories of his infectious warmth and charming personality. \"He always seemed to have enough time to make his customers feel special, and a remarkable ability for remembering names as well as faces. \"We would like to thank everyone who has sent kind messages and letters since his death in Addenbrooke's Hospital a few days ago.\" His funeral will take place on Wednesday at 10am at the Church of Our Lady and The English Martyrs in Hills Road.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "CAMBRIDGE", "latitude": 52.2, "longitude": 0.116667}, {"name": "Cherry Hinton", "latitude": 52.1833, "longitude": 0.183333}, {"name": "Flumeri", "latitude": 41.0778, "longitude": 15.1477}, {"name": "Italy", "latitude": 42.8333, "longitude": 12.8333}, {"name": "England", "latitude": 52.1605, "longitude": -0.703125}, {"name": "Kentford", "latitude": 52.2667, "longitude": 0.5}, {"name": "Newmarket", "latitude": 52.25, "longitude": 0.416667}, {"name": "Cambridge", "latitude": 52.2, "longitude": 0.116667}, {"name": "Cambridge", "latitude": 52.2, "longitude": 0.116667}, {"name": "Cambridge", "latitude": 52.2, "longitude": 0.116667}, {"name": "Cambridge", "latitude": 52.2, "longitude": 0.116667}, {"name": "Arbury", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Chesterton", "latitude": 52.2167, "longitude": 0.133333}, {"name": "Hills Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Rebecca Rayner also picked up the High Sheriff Award for her tireless fundraising efforts and her work to mentor young cadets in the Huntingdon Sea Cadets. There were also awards for a leading member of the Fenzone youth council, Charlie Manders, and Robert McColl, who runs a bike repair training service in Peterborough. Mrs Pearson praised the actions of the civic-minded youngsters. \"These young people are shining lights in their communities,\" she said. \"Their selfless dedication to other people is most impressive. They have committed a huge amount of time to other people and I commend them for it.\" The awards were presented at St Ivo School, in St Ives, on Thursday, and were attended by the chief constable of Cambridgeshire police Julie Spence. The evening also saw the High Sheriff hand out more than \u00a38,700 to a variety of youth projects, including a project run by Romsey Mill, in Mill Road, Cambridge, to involve young people in volunteering at Anglesey Abbey. There was also a cash grant for East Cambridgeshire Girl Guides to follow the lead of their Newmarket colleagues to provide guiding opportunities for girls with special needs. The St Ives Youth Theatre, which performed at the awards evening, also picked up a grant to help it stage a musical called Tom Sawyer. There were also awards for various youth, Guide and Scouting groups across the county. \"It is a great pleasure to be able to distribute the money raised this year to so many resourceful young people who are making a difference to the lives of other young and not-so-young people in Cambridgeshire,\" Mrs Pearson added.

Prof Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, has made huge contributions to the field of cosmology, and particularly the study of black holes, during his career - his best-selling book, A Brief History Of Time, brought the subject to a popular audience.

Though students can be grateful for educators for many different reasons, Cambridge High Schooler Trevor Wilkinson has a special reason to thank science teacher Cliff Hoak. \"I'd just want to say 'Thank you' to Mr. Hoak. He saved my life,\" said the 13-year-old seventh-grader. With Wilkinson choking on a rag and barely able to breath, Mr. Hoak used the Heimlich Maneuver to help dislodge the rag from the boy's throat. \"I was in fourth period. It was free day in ATP (achievement test practice),\" he said. \"I asked (teacher Jennifer Carpenter) if I could go get my math so I could work on it in the free time, because I had homework. I was chewing on this rag and I was walking up the stairs and when I got to the top of the stairs close to my locker, I went to get a breath from chewing ... and it sucked into my wind pipe. At first I was calm. But I started panicking once I started running out of breath.\" \"He was going out with his class when it happened,\" Wilkinson said. \"He saw me and I got just enough breath to say I couldn't breath. He did the Heimlich two or three times. He couldn't get anything to work, so he went over to (Mr. Hoak's class) and knocked on his door and Mr. Hoak came rushing out and did the Heimlich on me.\" Though Hoak's efforts did not expel the rag -- a piece of cloth used to clean electronic devices, such as cell phones, iPods and eyeglasses -- the boy was able to swallow it and clear his airway. \"I went to the doctor,\" Wilkinson said. \"They couldn't take an X-ray because it was cloth. She checked my lungs and said it was OK.\" He said the rag would either dissolve or pass through his digestive system, according to his pediatrician. Named for American physician Dr. Henry Jay Heimlich, the Heimlich Maneuver involves the use of abdominal thrusts inward and upward, expelling air and forcing out an object lodged in the airway. Eric Stevens, paramedic with United Ambulance Service, was on hand at the school Friday to demonstrate to teacher Lisa Taylor's health students some of the techniques emergency medical personnel use to establish and maintain an open airway for a choking victim. \"We started talking about severe burns and bleeding and we brought in choking due to the fact that there was a student in our school system that was choking,\" Taylor said. \"And when I asked the kids if anyone had any classes on this, maybe three of the 25 students raised their hand. So I thought this was good to bring it to our class and to at least be experienced with it. I'm very thankful that United Ambulance Service came on such short notice to show us the proper procedures on what to do.\" Middle school students are not eligible for certification in the use of the Heimlich Maneuver, though that is available to high schoolers. \"The kids around were concerned. The kids that were watching him ... they couldn't believe he was actually choking,\" she said. \"I think some kids were crying and really emotional. (Hoak) acted calmly and quickly and was able to handle the situation. We're really pleased to have teachers who know what to do in that type of situation.\" \"I was lucky I was in the right place at the right time,\" he said. \"Mr. Hoak was calm about it.

The number of child support cases pending through the first two months of 2008 totaled 14. During the same period in 2009 that number has more than doubled to 31. Common Pleas Judge David A.

MOUNT GILEAD (AP) -- A city court won't accept new cases because it's out of paper and has no money to reorder. Elsewhere, more firefighters are accepting wage decreases to save their jobs, and administrators at another state university are freezing their pay. Public entities around Ohio are hoping gestures like these will protect them from bigger problems caused by the recession. The gestures come when there's no relief in sight for battered Ohio, whose unemployment rate has hit 8.8 percent, a two-decade high. Tax revenue is flat at best or plunging at worst as layoffs continue and residents sew up their wallets and pocketbooks. In Mount Gilead, Judge Lee McClelland, of Morrow County Municipal Court in north-central Ohio, says the court has just enough paper to handle hearing notices and other documents for pending cases. He says several county agencies have volunteered to bring their own paper in to handle their filings. The court also is switching to a four-day work week to save money. In Euclid, in the northeast, firefighters agreed to a 2-percent pay cut and less money for continuing education and retirement funds for new firefighters in exchange for no layoffs. The city already has laid off 17 jail employees and is hoping to avoid police department layoffs. In Youngstown, Mayor Jay Williams wants city employees to work four fewer hours a week, equivalent to a 10 percent pay cut, to avoid layoffs. He's also taking a 10 percent cut, or about $10,500 in wages and benefits. Youngstown State University President David Sweet, who makes about $230,000 a year, said Friday he and eight top university officials will give up their 3 percent pay raises to create a new student financial aid fund. Earlier this month, Ohio State University said it would freeze the pay of President Gordon Gee and 18 members of his management team and put the money toward student scholarships. Top administrators at Wright State University will give up raises this year and contribute to an emergency relief fund for students. In Mansfield, Richland County Sheriff Steve Sheldon is scheduled to lay off 11 employees, though grant money saved an extra three jobs that were to be cut. The police union is proposing alternatives to layoffs, including eliminating part-time or seasonal jobs first. In Columbus, city firefighters agreed to a pay freeze to avoid layoffs. Police declined the offer and were about to lose 25 newly hired recruits when Mayor Michael Coleman announced $1.25 million in federal stimulus money would save their jobs for now. But small gestures won't work in every cash-strapped city. Toledo Mayor Carty Finkbeiner says he plans in May to lay off 75 police officers, about 12 percent of the division, if the city doesn't receive $35 million in federal stimulus funds.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "MOUNT GILEAD", "latitude": 40.5492, "longitude": -82.8274}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Mount Gilead", "latitude": 40.5492, "longitude": -82.8274}, {"name": "Morrow County", "latitude": 40.5334, "longitude": -82.7832}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Euclid", "latitude": 41.5931, "longitude": -81.5268}, {"name": "Youngstown", "latitude": 41.0998, "longitude": -80.6495}, {"name": "Youngstown", "latitude": 41.0998, "longitude": -80.6495}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Mansfield", "latitude": 40.7584, "longitude": -82.5154}, {"name": "Richland County", "latitude": 40.7834, "longitude": -82.5499}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 39.9612, "longitude": -82.9988}, {"name": "Toledo", "latitude": 41.6639, "longitude": -83.5552}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

BYESVILLE -- Firefighters are searching for the cause of a blaze Monday morning that heavily damaged an Indian Lake Road residence approximately 14 months after a house at that same address was destroyed by fire. A spokesperson for the Byesville Volunteer Fire Department said the cause may be electrical, but the fire remains under investigation. The fire at the home of Rose Bench, 9025 Indian Lake Road, was first reported at approximately 8 a.m. It is believed to have started in the garage under the home. The Guernsey County Sheriff's Office reported receiving multiple 911 calls advising of the blaze. Neighbors were concerned Bench may have still been inside the home. A crew from United Ambulance was reportedly the first emergency responders to arrive on scene. \"The neighbors tried to get inside, but they were unable to open the door,\" said Steve Helton of United Ambulance. \"We went around and kicked in the back door, but the smoke was already almost to the floor. \"We got as low as possible and went inside where we were able to yell for anybody inside, but there was no response,\" added Helton, who is also a Cambridge firefighter, of the effort to locate Bench. Working with Helton was fellow United Ambulance employee and firefighter Ron Brokaw. A dispatcher with the sheriff's office located Bench a short time later at her place of employment. Firefighters launched an initial attack on the flames through the kitchen located above the garage and then through the garage until the flames were knocked down. Providing mutual aid at the scene were firefighters from the Cambridge, Pleasant City and Lore City departments. A search of the home was conducted once the flames were under control and a recovery effort was later launched to remove salvageable items from the home. In addition to the heavy fire damage, the house sustained extensive smoke and water damage. A 2006 Dodge Dakota truck parked in the garage was also heavily damaged. No firefighters were injured fighting the fire. Firefighters cleared the scene at approximately 10:30 a.m. In January 2008, a fire at a home at that same location destroyed the residence and injured a neighbor, who later succumbed to his injuries. Neighbors reported construction to replace the home had just recently finished.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Gov. Ted Strickland's budget proposal shortchanges special education by using a faulty funding formula, cutting vital programs and relying too heavily on one-time federal stimulus money, advocates said. Strickland's education funding model doesn't account for the cost of additional teacher time needed to instruct children with learning disabilities, the Ohio Coalition for the Education of Children with Disabilities said in a letter sent Monday to the Strickland administration and state lawmakers. Strickland's two-year budget proposal cuts all budget earmarks \u2014 including a $1.5 million program to mentor parents of special needs students. It replaces a significant share of the state's funding responsibility for special education with federal economic stimulus money, an apparent violation of federal mandates that would require a waiver, said coalition Executive Director Margaret Burley. \"I'm still puzzled,\" Burley said Friday. \"There seems to be a big emphasis on early childhood learning but not for children with disabilities.\" The Strickland administration has acknowledged that the funding formula is a problem that needs to be resolved. \"Quite frankly, we believe this is a valid criticism of the proposal,\" said John Stanford, Strickland's education adviser. \"We are still in conversation with the coalition about the issue.\" Both Burley and state Rep. Ron Amstutz, the ranking Republican on the House Finance and Appropriations Committee, said it has been difficult to get information about the school funding formula from the Strickland administration. \"People are allowed to make mistakes. We just want them to get corrected,\" said Burley, who's optimistic the formula will be revised. The state is spending $470.5 million in the fiscal year ending in June on special education funding \u2014 all state money. Strickland has proposed an increase of $56 million for the next fiscal year, but the state's share of the funding would drop to 58 percent because of the federal stimulus money. This would appear to require a waiver from the federal government because the state is generally required to maintain its funding for special education, Amstutz and Burley said. Stanford said the federal government has not yet given clearance for the state's proposed use of stimulus money. \"We will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education to make sure that the program that we have developed in the state of Ohio is compliant with all federal rules,\" he said. Advocates and Republican lawmakers are also concerned that the reliance on federal money would create funding gaps in the future. \"I think we owe it to them to look further than the next meal of federal funds because we don't have any reason to expect that to continue,\" said Amstutz, of Wooster. Burley said the special education community also continues to be upset about what has been a longtime defect in allocating money to programs. The funding model assumes a base teacher salary for preschool special education of $17,500 \u2014 the figure that was pertinent in 1989. Strickland's new \"evidence-based\" funding model for all education assumes an average teacher salary of about $45,000. Burley said the lagging salary number for preschool special education has decreased the share of state spending over time, forcing local districts to make up the difference. \"Preschool kids are where we can make the most gains,\" Burley said. \"The evidence shows they are ready to learn and we have to give them the building blocks they need to continue their education.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "COLUMBUS", "latitude": 39.9612, "longitude": -82.9988}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Wooster", "latitude": 40.8051, "longitude": -81.9351}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

A convicted killer scheduled to die next month has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to delay his execution, alleging that a jailhouse informant committed perjury. Brett Hartmann said a motion filed Friday that he needs time to gather evidence of the alleged perjury and test other evidence he says will prove his innocence. The motion also asks the court to delay the execution to allow Hartmann time to demonstrate that Ohio's method of lethal injection is unconstitutional. He has said that it would deny him a quick and painless death as required by state law. The state Supreme Court this month denied an earlier request by Hartmann to delay his execution so he could challenge the state's execution method. Hartmann had asked for that stay to allow time for him to join a lawsuit pending in Franklin County that makes a similar challenge. Hartmann is scheduled to die April 7 for the fatal stabbing and mutilation of 46-year-old Wanda Snipes in Akron on Sept. 9, 1997. Documents and legal filings in the case refer to the inmate as Hartman, but he has said his name is Hartmann. The filing Friday said the state has repeatedly referred to the informant's testimony as critical evidence of Hartmann's guilt. The new evidence severely undermines the informant's credibility and casts doubt on the validity of the conviction, Hartmann's motion said. His motion also referred to testimony presented March 23 in a federal trial in Ohio that is part of another condemned inmate's challenge to the lethal injection process. The judge in the federal case is taking testimony from Ohio's execution team to determine whether condemned killer Kenneth Biros can prove he has a chance of making a successful argument against injection in a longer and more detailed trial. Hartmann's motion said testimony given in the federal court case provided evidence to demonstrate that Ohio's execution method carries \"substantial risk of harm, i.e. excruciating pain during the execution.\" It would be \"particularly unfair and inhumane\" to execute Hartmann within days of the first time that testimony became available to him and to the public, Hartmann's motion said. Hartmann has said he must be given the same opportunity as other death row inmates to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio's execution method.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Franklin County", "latitude": 39.9667, "longitude": -83.0166}, {"name": "Akron", "latitude": 41.0814, "longitude": -81.519}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

It could happen if emission fees approved. That's what two Republican state lawmakers fear will happen if federal officials move forward with plans to charge fees to farmers for livestock emissions. Sens. Tim Grendell, from Chesterland, and Bob Gibbs, from Lakeville, have introduced a resolution in the Ohio Senate urging quick passage of federal legislation exempting livestock from Clean Air Act fees. The resolution stems from a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled greenhouse gases are considered pollutants under the Clean Air Act. As such, entities with emissions of more than 100 tons per year would have to obtain the proper permits. It would take 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle, 200 hogs or 200 sheep to produce that amount of emissions, Grendell said. The two lawmakers, citing statistics compiled by the American Farm Bureau Federation, said the resulting Clean Air fees on livestock producers would range from $22 a head for hogs to $175 per head for dairy cows. \"I believe everyone understood those gases to be industrial gases and not gases produced by livestock,\" Grendell told reporters Wednesday. \"And in fact I would submit that before we should put a tax on gas produced by livestock, we would have to impose a tax on those who use Taco Bell.\" Their resolution, a symbolic gesture showing the state's stance on the issue, urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to implement new regulations on livestock producers, nor impose new fees on farmers for animals' emissions. \"The Clean Air Act was adopted to regulate and prevent air pollution from smokestack industries,\" Gibbs later testified before the Senate's natural resources committee.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Chesterland", "latitude": 41.5223, "longitude": -81.3379}, {"name": "Lakeville", "latitude": 40.6562, "longitude": -82.1271}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Photographs of artifacts taken from the Creel Burial Mound in South Charleston now have a permanent home at the new Mound Interpretive Center next to the LaBelle Theater in South Charleston. The new center will open to the public at 11 a.m. today after nearly five years of work and research by South Charleston officials and community leaders. \"Joe Mays was on city council and did the ground work to get this going,\" said Ben Paul, chairman of the center committee. The completion of the center was made possible through a $300,000-plus grant from the West Virginia Division of Highways, and the city added $80,000. The city-owned building was renovated by the public works department and designed by designminds, which planned and created the interpretive displays in the center. Along with the mound display and Native American artifacts, a portion of the center is devoted to the Midland Trail. Alice Hypes, executive director of the Midland Trail National Scenic Highway, represents the 180 miles of the trail in West Virginia. \"We're very excited about the exhibit,\" she said. \"Folks that come into the center can push a button and find out about the whole trail, which is one of the oldest in the country.\" In fact, Hypes said George Washington designed the original trail from Virginia Beach, Va., to Cedar Grove in 1790. Visitors to the center can discover the interesting points along the trail from Cabell County to Bluefield by selecting one of nine buttons that initiates an audio interpretation of a specific area along the trail. In addition to the Mound and Midland Trail sections of the center, there are displays of Blenko Glass and items from Union Carbide when it was in its heyday. The mound portion of the center focuses on the Adena Culture that built the mounds in the area. At one time there were more than 50 earthen mounds built by these Native Americans in our area from St. Albans to Kanawha City. Today, only three remain. One is located behind Sunset Memorial Park in South Charleston while another is at Shawnee Park in Institute. The largest remaining one is the South Charleston Mound, which is estimated to have been built between 250 and 100 B.C. \"This is the first time in 125 years that people can see what artifacts were discovered in the mound,\" said Mayor Mullins. \"We hope this center provides the public with a good image of the history of our area.\" Mullins also said he wants school groups to be a part of the center's programs by visiting and taking part in activities planned for the future. \"We want this center to be open to all, from individuals to schools, seniors, church groups and college students,\" he said. \"We hope that anyone who's interested in the history of the area will find the center exciting, enjoyable and educational.\" A large relief map of the three mounds still in the Kanawha Valley along with a wall map marked to indicate their location is also audio equipped. The display also shows a half-portion of a mound where visitors to the center can see what the Adena people buried in their mounds. A back hallway of the center is lined with pictures of the artifacts excavated in the 1800s by the Smithsonian Institution. Darla Spencer, a member of the West Virginia Council for Archaeology as well as the Native American History Council, took the pictures. The photos show necklaces of ocean shells that were made by the Adena people and fish darts, arrowheads, mussel shells, projectile points, stone disks and more. The Adena people were the first in this region to settle down in small villages, cultivate crops, use pottery vessels, acquire exotic raw materials, such as copper and marine shells to make ornaments and jewelry and to bury their honored dead in burial mounds. The period of the Adena's existence is estimated from 500 BC to 1000 AD. Mary Ann Wade and Gloria Shirkey will be operating the center and be available to answer any questions visitors might have. \"At least we hope so,\" said Wade. \"We also have a video or sound library of 13 CDs of historical artifacts of the city of South Charleston that we can play for visitors too.\" When the center opens Friday, there will be a group of school children from South Charleston among the first visitors. \"We hope that kids will utilize the center at every opportunity,\" said Mayor Mullins. \"It's the community's place now and we hope folks will visit often.\" The Mound Interpretive Center is on D Street in South Charleston and will be open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "S.C.", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "SOUTH CHARLESTON", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "W.Va.", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "Midland Trail", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Midland Trail", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "Virginia Beach", "latitude": 36.8529, "longitude": -75.978}, {"name": "Va.", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Cedar Grove", "latitude": 38.2212, "longitude": -81.4279}, {"name": "Cabell County", "latitude": 38.4334, "longitude": -82.2499}, {"name": "Bluefield", "latitude": 37.2698, "longitude": -81.2223}, {"name": "St. Albans", "latitude": 38.3857, "longitude": -81.8362}, {"name": "Kanawha City", "latitude": 38.3215, "longitude": -81.5821}, {"name": "Sunset Memorial Park", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "Shawnee Park", "latitude": 38.3779, "longitude": -81.7596}, {"name": "Institute", "latitude": 38.3837, "longitude": -81.7654}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "Kanawha Valley", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "D Street", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Police wrote in the complaint that they found a gun in a creek bed along the route Jones took to evade arrest. While searching Jones at police headquarters, officers retrieved two baggies of white rocks, believed to be crack cocaine, from Jones' underwear, the complaint said. The substance in the bags, which totaled about 8.6 grams, later tested positive as cocaine, according to the complaint. Police discovered that Jones had been convicted in 2004 of selling controlled substances in Bronx County, N.Y, which makes him ineligible to possess a gun, the complaint said.

Kanawha County high school students will have to sit out a year of sports if they transfer from one county school to another after the start of their ninth grade year, school board members decided. At a tense and combative meeting Thursday night, the board approved the plan aimed at eliminating the recruiting of high school athletes. Board members say behavior by some coaches, boosters and parents are ruining community schools, promoting unsportsmanlike conduct and overshadowing academics. School officials are trying to correct what they said was a loophole in country policy. To get around a yearlong sports ban that applied to students who transferred from one school district to another, parents were renting apartments, moving into other family members' homes or changing custody of their children to prove they had \"moved.\" That exempted the students from the ban. After Thursday's vote, any Kanawha County student who switches high schools after the start of their ninth-grade year, for any reason, can't play sports for a year. The last chance to transfer without facing the ban is as an incoming freshman, right out of middle school. Board members signed off on the change with the caveat that they might soon consider additional restrictions, including requiring transfer students to keep a higher grade point average to play sports. The board had voted down a more stringent transfer policy earlier Thursday. That proposal would have barred any student in middle school and high school from playing sports for a year if he or she either changed schools or started as a new student in the county. It would have applied even to students who moved with their families from another county or state. Steve Hurley told the board he was recently laid off from his job at American Woodmark. He said he planned to move from Grant County to Nitro with his family to find work. \"And now, all of the sudden, the kids don't want to move because they want to play sports,\" he said. \"We're trying to move four hours to better our family and the school system says, 'No, you can't do that,'\" Hurley said. Board members Jim Crawford and Bill Raglin voted for that stricter policy. But board president Becky Jordon and board members Pete Thaw and Robin Rector voted it down. Jordon then attempted to build consensus for the compromise plan. In a 3-2 vote, the board approved the less strict policy change. Crawford and Raglin voted against it, saying it was not strong enough. Raglin specifically argued that the final policy still has too much potential for loopholes. He said students are being recruited and lured to schools to play sports and provide entertainment for fans, and then they are abandoned academically. \"I'm here to represent the concerns of the students whose parents aren't concerned,\" Raglin said. He said data given to him by Superintendent Ron Duerring show that high school athletes who transfer schools perform worse academically than other transfer students. Raglin suggested requiring a GPA of 2.5 or above for student athletes who transfer from one county school to another. The current GPA requirement is 2.0 for all student athletes. \"A 2.0 GPA guarantees one thing: consideration for a job, maybe at McDonald's,\" he said. But Kackie Eller, a guidance counselor at George Washington High School, said some of the proposed restrictions could spell \"the end of school sports as we know them.\" She said students are increasingly turning to athletic programs outside of school, especially church league basketball, to avoid confusing eligibility rules now in place. Eller raised concern that some of the proposed policy changes would punish many students because of the actions of the few. \"I don't understand why they can't just come down on the coaches,\" she said. \"The failure of this system has been our failure,\" Thaw said. \"We've allowed the overzealous coaches. We've allowed the indiscriminate boosters.\" Several board members suggested that whatever policy they adopted, they would be willing to hear appeals and grant exceptions in some cases.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Grant County", "latitude": 39.1168, "longitude": -79.1998}, {"name": "Nitro", "latitude": 38.4148, "longitude": -81.844}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The Dow Chemical Co. announced that French engineering company Alstom will build a pilot plant to capture carbon dioxide from the flue gas at Dow's coal-fired power plant in South Charleston. The companies said Alstom will design, construct and operate the pilot plant and Dow will provide the site, the utilities and the chemicals. The plant will use amine technology jointly developed by Alstom and Dow. Amines are organic compounds. Gov. Joe Manchin said, \"We're tickled to death they're coming here. This is research that we think has an awful lot of promise. If we could retrofit coal-fired plants, what a break that is. \"It seems that chemists have found things that can drop carbon out of the stack. We think this could be the key that unlocks the future of how we'll be able to deal with the carbon that's coming off of existing coal-fired power plants.\" Jim Guidarini, Dow's West Virginia site leader, said the South Charleston power plant has the only coal-fired boiler owned by Dow Chemical in the United States. The power plant has three boilers -- two that burn natural gas and one that burns coal. The pilot plant will test the Alstom-Dow amine carbon capture process on the coal-fired boiler's flue gas. Work on the pad for the pilot plant began several weeks ago, Guidarini said. About 20 construction workers will be on site at the height of construction. \"We expect construction to be done in another couple of months,\" he said. The plant is expected to begin operating by the third quarter of this year. Alstom then will have five people on site to operate it. \"We expect it to run for two years,\" Guidarini said. \"It depends on what we learn. That's why we're doing a pilot -- to learn things.\" Asked about the plant's price tag, Guidarini said, \"We're not releasing any cost information on it.\" \"The way the amine process works is, you scrub the carbon dioxide out of the vent stream with the amines,\" Guidarini said. \"You have a reactive product. Then you get the carbon dioxide off and you have pure carbon dioxide. The idea going forward in large plants is, you sequester the carbon dioxide somehow. In this plant we're just testing the first piece -- how do you capture the carbon dioxide, how do you get it off the amines?\" The carbon dioxide that is captured will be released, he said. \"The problem with carbon dioxide is, it's tough to use,\" said. \"It's not very reactive. It's a hard feedstock to do anything with. You don't hear of anybody doing anything with carbon dioxide because it's tough to do. But that's something Dow in the future is certainly looking at.\" Manchin said, \"The money will be in the research to figure out what you do with the carbon. It's like when we burned coal and had refuse piles. Then they captured sulfur with a limestone spray and had another byproduct. Now they're using that byproduct to make gypsum board. There's got to be a way to solidify carbon and use it for fuel.\" The cost of removing carbon dioxide is considered an energy loss, since the energy needed for the process is subtracted from that generated by a power plant. Guidarini said Dow believes its proprietary amines technology is much less energy intensive than other processes. The pilot plant will capture about 1,800 tons of carbon dioxide a year. This is the second carbon capture project to be announced in West Virginia. The other project is much larger. Alstom, American Electric Power and German utility conglomerate RWE are building it at American Electric's Mountaineer power plant in Mason County. American Electric is investing about $76 million in the Mason County project, which is designed to capture about 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Alstom has said that research shows its technology may only cause an energy loss of 10 percent. In addition to capturing carbon dioxide, the Mason County project will chill it to a liquid using Alstom's Chilled Ammonia Process. The liquid will be permanently stored underground. American Electric is working with subcontractor Battelle Memorial Institute on the storage system. The Mason County project is expected to begin operating in September.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "French", "latitude": 46.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "South Charleston", "latitude": 38.3684, "longitude": -81.6996}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "German", "latitude": 51.5, "longitude": 10.5}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Mason County", "latitude": 38.8001, "longitude": -82.0001}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Mason County", "latitude": 38.8001, "longitude": -82.0001}, {"name": "Mason County", "latitude": 38.8001, "longitude": -82.0001}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Mason County", "latitude": 38.8001, "longitude": -82.0001}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Officials at Tri-State Racetrack & Gaming Center say they intend to proceed with a $250 million expansion project at the Kanawha County track and casino despite bad economic conditions that have hit the gambling industry particularly hard. Dan Adkins, vice president of Hartman & Tyner Inc., which owns the facility in Nitro, said he met with Gov. Joe Manchin on Thursday to talk about the track's future and assure state officials that he intended to make good on promises to build a hotel and entertainment complex at the track. \"I'm not coming with my hat off and my hand out,\" Adkins said Friday. He said he does not intend to ask state lawmakers to push back deadlines for a table-gaming referendum and the construction timetable at the track and casino. John Melton, attorney for the West Virginia Lottery Commission, said recently that the 2007 law allowing the expansion of table games requires the hotel to be up and running at Tri-State by the August 2010 deadline, not merely under construction. If Tri-State's owners fail to complete the hotel in time, they face a $2.5 million annual penalty until the hotel is open. With ground unbroken, no architect yet announced for the project and time running out, state and county officials are beginning to wonder whether Tri-State will be able to make the deadline. \"I think Tri-State has publicly committed to build a hotel, and will build it,\" said Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper, who said he has watched the progress of Tri-State's plans closely. \"If they don't, the penalty is pretty unpleasant for them. They said they'd build it, and they need to build it,\" Carper said, but conceded that the hotel might not be finished in time to meet the deadline. \"To me, it wouldn't be the end of the world if it were delayed a year,\" he said. \"I just want to see it built.\" When the Legislature passed the law allowing local voters to approve the expansion of gambling to include table games such as poker and blackjack, the law required a vote after another five years so voters could decide if they wanted table gaming to continue. The law also required Tri-State to build a hotel. The state's other racetracks already have hotels at their facilities. Kanawha County voters approved table gaming at Tri-State Racetrack in August 2007. Carper said Adkins has had considerable trouble finding financing for the proposed $250 million expansion at Tri-State. The project includes a hotel of at least 200 rooms, a conference center and entertainment complex. \"You can't blame everything on Tri-State,\" Carper said. \"It's not their fault the economy is in the tank.\" The pain is being felt across the gambling industry. Last year, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, which runs the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, filed for bankruptcy. The company that runs Donald Trump's casino empire filed for bankruptcy in February. Herbst Gambling Inc., which operates a casino in Iowa, two more in Missouri and 12 in Nevada, announced plans to file for bankruptcy last week, according to the Des Moines Register newspaper. Carper said he was told that Adkins intended to ask state officials to push back the deadline on the table-gaming referendum to make it easier to secure financing for the project. With the referendum on table games looming, Carper said, investors or banking officials probably will be reluctant to loan a lot of money on a project that voters might decide they don't want anymore. \" [Extending the deadline] will assist them in getting financing,\" Carper said. Adkins acknowledges that times are hard and it has been tough to finance the expansion project, but he said he would not ask state officials to push back any deadlines for the track. \"We don't file bankruptcy,\" Adkins said. \"We're going to proceed with what we said we're going to do, with our own money.\" Matt Turner, spokesman for Gov. Manchin, confirmed that Adkins met with the governor Thursday to discuss \"the future of the racetrack.\" He said Manchin was \"encouraged\" by the conversation. Adkins said he hoped to pick an architect for the expansion project on Friday.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "CHARLESTON", "latitude": 38.3498, "longitude": -81.6326}, {"name": "W.Va.", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "Nitro", "latitude": 38.4148, "longitude": -81.844}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "Las Vegas", "latitude": 36.175, "longitude": -115.137}, {"name": "Iowa", "latitude": 42.0003, "longitude": -93.5005}, {"name": "Missouri", "latitude": 38.2503, "longitude": -92.5005}, {"name": "Nevada", "latitude": 39.2502, "longitude": -116.751}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Lewisburg Mayor John Manchester on Monday had a bird's-eye view of President Obama signing into law a bill granting wilderness protection to more than 2 million acres of land, including 37,771 acres in the Monongahela National Forest. \"For some reason, they stuck me in the second row,\" Manchester said after the signing. \"It was a wonderful ceremony, and I got to shake the president's hand and meet a lot of the congressional leaders.\" Manchester was among about 150 supporters of various pieces of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 who were invited to attend the bill-signing ceremony at the White House. The legislation protects tracts of federally managed land in nine states, from Oregon to Virginia. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W. Va., chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and a longtime backer of the legislation, was among 13 U.S. senators and representatives in attendance, along with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. \"As Americans, we possess few blessings greater than the vast and varied landscapes that stretch the breadth of our continent,\" Obama said. The new law, he added, guarantees that Americans \"will not take our forests, rivers, oceans, national parks, monuments and wilderness areas for granted, but rather we will set them aside and guard their sanctity for everyone to share. That's something all Americans can support.\" In West Virginia, the Wild Monongahela Act, which was a component of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, creates three new wilderness areas in the Monongahela National Forest, and adds acreage to three existing wilderness areas. The new areas are the 6,280-acre Roaring Plains West Wilderness, which abuts the existing Dolly Sods Wilderness east of Canaan Valley; the 7,142-acre Spice Run Wilderness on the east slope of the Greenbrier River Valley near the Greenbrier-Pocahontas County boundary; and the 5,242-acre Big Draft Wilderness along Anthony Creek at the extreme south end of the Monongahela near Lewisburg. The act also added 7,215 acres to the north end of the Dolly Sods Wilderness; 12,032 acres between the Williams and Cranberry rivers in the Cranberry Wilderness; and 740 acres near the Dry Fork River to the Otter Creek Wilderness. Manchester was among wilderness supporters who testified before Rahall's committee last year. \"I spoke on the value of wilderness to my community,\" he said. \"There are a lot of tourists who love to explore wild places, and as soon as these new wilderness areas are on the map, we'll have another arrow in our quiver for our marketing campaign. I expect the new wilderness areas will give the state a significant bump in its tourism base.\" Elsewhere in the nation, the act added nearly 50,000 acres of wilderness to Virginia's Jefferson National Forest, and granted wilderness protection to land along Mount Hood's northeastern slopes in Oregon, to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan, in Utah's Zion National Park and in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "CHARLESTON", "latitude": 38.3498, "longitude": -81.6326}, {"name": "W.Va.", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "Lewisburg", "latitude": 37.8018, "longitude": -80.4456}, {"name": "Monongahela National Forest", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Oregon", "latitude": 44.0001, "longitude": -120.501}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "W.

But East Bank Mayor Chuck Blair said Monday that he expects the major thoroughfare to be shut down at least two days. \"They're still trying to determine how much damage there is,\" Blair said. Kanawha County Emergency Services Director Dale Petry said an old, abandoned mine that had been dormantor for years started overflowing early Monday, sending hundreds of thousands of gallons of water cascading across W.Va. 61 and onto First Avenue in East Bank and forcing tons of rock and earth onto the road near the western end of town. \"There's a deep mine up there that has been accumulating water for years and years and years,\" Petry said.

The problem was all the water that had spilled into the school's parking lot, Vickers said. After speaking with county transportation director George Beckett, Vickers said she believed bus drivers would be able to get students to the school safely. Petry said the slide forced the evacuation of one family whose driveway was obliterated by the mass of mud and water. Stacy Auber, who lives downhill from the old mine, said relatives called her about 6:20 a.m. and told her about the mudslide. Soon, a dump truck belonging to the family went sliding over the hill. Auber grabbed some clothes and left her house by about 10:30 a.m. She was allowed to return home Monday afternoon. But Johnny Walker, a highways administrator with the state Division of Highways, said highways officials can't even begin to guess how long it will take to clear away the debris and reopen W.Va. 61. He said it all depends on how badly the tons of mud and water damaged the two-lane highway. \"We've got a piling wall along that entire section, and it's undercut all of that,\" Walker said. Highways officials need to determine whether the ground beneath the road was undermined, and they won't know that until water stops pouring across the asphalt. Petry said discharge from the mine portal had slowed down by mid-afternoon, but that water continued to gush out of the abandoned mine at a rate of about 2,000 gallons per minute. Emergency officials reopened narrow First Avenue Monday afternoon to allow residents access to their homes, but the single-lane street will be open only to passenger vehicles. Mud and water also closed the inner set of railroad tracks, Petry said. All but local traffic was being rerouted at Cabin Creek Road and Paint Creek Road. \"We're kind of on pins and needles now to see what happens next with it,\" Blair said Monday afternoon. \"We don't know how much water is up there to come out.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "W.Va. 61", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "W.Va. 61", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "W.Va. 61", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "W.Va. 61", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "First Avenue", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "East Bank", "latitude": 38.2182, "longitude": -81.4429}, {"name": "W.Va. 61", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "First Avenue", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Cabin Creek Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Paint Creek Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A Charleston man admitted in Kanawha Circuit Court on Monday that he gunned down his longtime girlfriend in a West Side Taco Bell in July 2008. Desmond Demetrius Clark, 22, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, saying he shot Na'lisha Gravely, 19, with whom he had a son. \"I shot 'Lisha in the Taco Bell,\" Clark said. \"I later learned that she died from it.\" As part of the plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop two wanton endangerment charges and a kidnapping charge against Clark. Clark, who had a lengthy history of domestic violence against Gravely, followed her into the Patrick Street restaurant, where she had apparently fled from him during an argument. Video surveillance appeared to show Clark hopping the counter moments before he fired into the closet where Gravely was hiding. Chief Kanawha Circuit Judge Jim Stucky accepted Clark's plea, and set his sentencing for June 2. Both sides are free to call witnesses and argue whether or not Clark's life sentence should come with a recommendation of mercy, meaning that he could eventually be paroled. Clark was captured following a brief manhunt. His arrest and subsequent murder charges set off an uproar, in part because of his extensive criminal history and in part because he was subject of a domestic violence protective order taken out by Gravely when he killed her. Clark turned and quietly said \"I love you\" to his supporters before he was led out of the courtroom. Gravely's family and friends left the courtroom without talking to reporters. After the hearing, Plants said he was pleased with the conviction and that he plans to ask Stucky to send Clark to prison for the rest of his life. \"The facts of this case are just brutal. He shot her in broad daylight. He admitted it,\" Plants said. Clark told Stucky that his son now lives with Gravely's family. Defense attorney Theresa Chisolm said Clark wanted to accept responsibility for his actions. Plants said Gravely's tragic murder brought additional attention to the issue of domestic violence. \"Women who are in the cycle of abuse need to get out of the cycle,\" he said. Earlier this month, the state Supreme Court touted the launch of its electronic domestic violence registry, which gives police officers statewide electronic access to domestic violence protective orders like the one a Kanawha County Family Court judge issued to Gravely on May 28, 2008. According to that order, Clark and Gravely were not supposed to be around each other until Aug. 28, 2008, a few days after she would have turned 20. A Dunbar police officer pulled over a car driven by Clark with Gravely in the passenger seat on the day of the murder, but, apparently unaware of the protective order, he ticketed Clark for driving on a suspended license and for having a small amount of marijuana. Clark was on probation at the time, having been sentenced by Stucky to two years probation in March 2008 for felony possession with intent to distribute and several misdemeanors. The domestic violence registry is now up and running in 14 counties, but those do not yet include Kanawha County, Supreme Court administrative director Steve Canterbury said Monday. A bailiff leads Desmond Clark out of the courtroom following his guilty plea Monday.

On Monday, House Minority Leader Tim Armstead tried bring the resolution to the floor for a vote by moving to discharge it from committee. \"The overwhelming majority of West Virginians have let us know in no uncertain terms they want us to take action on this issue,\" the Kanawha County Republican said, adding that 30 other states have approved constitutional amendments on marriage. \"It's time for us to listen to the people we represent.\" Since 2000, West Virginia has had a Defense of Marriage Act, which bars the state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. But Armstead said recent events in other states dictated the state should amend its constitution. \"I think we've seen over the past few years why it's so urgent,\" he said. He pointed to legal challenges to Proposition 8 in California and the recognition of gay marriage in Massachusetts. \"This is an urgent issue,\" Armstead said. \"It's an issue that needs to be addressed. It's an issue we feel very strongly about.\" But the House voted 67-30 -- almost entirely along party lines -- to postpone Armstead's motion indefinitely, meaning the resolution can't be considered again this session. Delegates also passed a motion to cut off debate on the issue. The only comments from Democrats came from House Majority Leader Brent Boggs, D-Braxton, a sponsor of the resolution. Boggs said the legislative process had to take precedence over delegates' personal feelings on the issue. \"It's not good public policy to bypass the committee process,\" he said, reading from a prepared speech. Besides Armstead and Boggs, other sponsors of the resolution are Delegates Harold Michael, D-Hardy; Ricky Moye, D-Raleigh; John Overington, R-Berkeley; Linda Sumner, R-Raleigh; and Clif Moore, D-McDowell. Earlier this month, a telephone campaign by the Family Policy Council of West Virginia targeted House Judiciary Chairwoman Carrie Webster, D-Kanawha, and House Constitutional Revision Chairwoman Barbara Fleischauer, D-Monongalia. The council claimed the two delegates were blocking a ban on gay marriage, since their committees would have to approve the resolution. Webster, whose committee never saw the bill, said the campaign led to the harassment of her staff.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Kanawha County", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "California", "latitude": 37.2502, "longitude": -119.751}, {"name": "Massachusetts", "latitude": 42.3656, "longitude": -71.1083}, {"name": "Braxton", "latitude": 38.7168, "longitude": -80.6998}, {"name": "Hardy", "latitude": 39.0168, "longitude": -78.8164}, {"name": "Raleigh", "latitude": 37.7501, "longitude": -81.2498}, {"name": "Berkeley", "latitude": 39.4501, "longitude": -78.0331}, {"name": "Raleigh", "latitude": 37.7568, "longitude": -81.1743}, {"name": "McDowell", "latitude": 37.3668, "longitude": -81.6498}, {"name": "West Virginia", "latitude": 38.5004, "longitude": -80.5001}, {"name": "Kanawha", "latitude": 38.3334, "longitude": -81.5665}, {"name": "Monongalia", "latitude": 39.6501, "longitude": -80.0331}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The Charles Webb Center for developmentally disabled kids, which has survived on donations for nearly three months, is hoping for another miracle. The center has funding to stay open through Friday. It may be able to secure a grant this week to keep it running through April 3. The community has kept the center afloat since Jan. 1 with more than $30,000 in donations. The state Department of Disabilities and Special Needs cut $150,000 in annual funding for the center in response to a General Assembly mandate to trim $21.5 million or 11.2 percent from its budget. On the state House floor last week, Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, tried unsuccessfully to restore $250,000 in funding for the Webb Center and another center for developmentally disabled children in Anderson. \"They knocked it down,\" Gilliard said. \"I'm still soliciting private donations to keep the Webb Center afloat. It's an invaluable service to our children,\" he said. No one knows that better than Mindy Miller of Ravenel, whose son, Parker, 8, has Fragile X syndrome and is developmentally delayed by about three years. He has been at the Webb Center for nearly seven years.

After school, he takes a bus to the Webb Center on Evergreen Street, where he is picked up when his parents leave their business, Miller Signs, about 6 p.m. Several of the parents have said that if the Webb Center closes, it could mean they would have to quit their jobs to stay home to care for a special needs child. Parents learned Nov. 13 that the center would close at the end of the year because of state budget cuts. Kids at the center range from infants to age 10 and have developmental problems such as autism and mental retardation. The center has a staff of eight. The state Department of Disabilities and Special Needs cut funds for five child day-care programs, including the Webb Center. State Sen. Robert Ford, D-Charleston, said he is optimistic about restoring state funding to the Webb Center in the new budget year beginning July 1. \"We're almost sure that we're going to be able to do it,\" Ford said. The state money enables the center to receive matching Medicaid funds to meet its budget, officials said. On March 6, Ford, Gilliard and Senate President Pro Tem Glenn McConnell, R-Charleston, donated a total of $5,000 to the center. Ford said he has spoken with Sen. Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman, a Republican from Florence, who has been impressed with support for the center from local legislators. Ford said that House Speaker Bobby Harrell, R-Charleston, can pave the way for restoring center funding in the House. Ford said he thinks that the center also could be the beneficiary of federal stimulus money. Meanwhile, the Webb Center will be living from week-to-week on the largesse of the community. \"I can definitely go through next week. We're hoping for another two weeks,\" said Rick Magner, director of the Disabilities Board of Charleston County.

A judge ruled Monday that Columbia taxpayers owe design firm Stevens & Wilkinson money for a publicly funded hotel the city never built. The Columbia-based design firm says the city owes it $1.6 million for work it completed on a publicly funded convention center hotel project from December 2003 to April 2004. Two weeks ago, city attorneys rejected a $1.6 million settlement offer from Stevens & Wilkinson, saying the two entities never had a contract. Monday, Circuit Court Judge Casey Manning ruled the city did have a contract with Stevens & Wilkinson but did not rule if or how much money the city had to pay. That question will be settled later, in front of either a jury or a judge. But it means city taxpayers likely will have to pay something at a time when the city is furloughing its employees and cutting $4 million in order to make its budget this year. It\u2019s unclear if the city will appeal the decision. Kathleen McDaniel, an attorney with Callison Tighe & Robinson, which represents the city, said Monday night she had not had time to review the order and declined to comment. \u201cThis ruling is a dramatic development on behalf of Stevens & Wilkinson,\u201d said attorney Dick Harpootlian, who represents the design firm. \u201cThey owe us something, the amount to be determined.\u201d Manning\u2019s order, known as a partial summary judgment, is rare for a plaintiff, the party who brings the lawsuit, said John Nichols, past president of the S.C. Trial Lawyers Association, now known as the S.C. Association for Justice. \u201cThe plaintiff always has the burden of proof and the burden of production to start a lawsuit off,\u201d Nichols said. It\u2019s more likely that a defendant would win summary judgment, he said. In issuing his order, Manning cited the deposition testimony of three people: interim city manager Steve Gantt, Councilwoman Tameika Isaac Devine and Charles Phillips, an expert hired by the city. Further testimony is expected before it is determined what the city owes. Devine, an attorney, is the only council member to give a deposition so far. Attorneys for the city have asked Manning to prevent other council members from testifying on the grounds of legislative privilege \u2014 the legal doctrine that prevents public officials from being asked to explain their votes. In 2003, the city decided it would build and operate a hotel across from the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center. City Council hired Stevens & Wilkinson, Turner Construction, Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development to work on the project. All the parties signed a memorandum of understanding. However, in April 2004, after considerable public opposition to the project, City Council voted to give $4.5 million for a private developer \u2014 Bo Aughtry \u2014 to build the hotel, a Hilton, which opened in August 2007. In 2005, the four companies that had worked on the public hotel project sued the city, saying the city\u2019s memorandum of understanding was a contract, and by going with a privately developed hotel, the city broke that contract. The companies are asking for the money the city would have paid them had the public hotel project gone forward. Monday\u2019s ruling does not affect the status of the other companies; their portion of the lawsuit is still pending. \u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be a lot of dominoes to fall,\u201d said attorney Brink Hinson, who represents Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development. Stevens & Wilkinson is asking for an additional $1.6 million for work it says it completed on the project from December 2003 to April 2004. In July 2003, after working three months on the project, Stevens & Wilkinson said they were stopping their work until the city could borrow the money to pay for the hotel. Stevens & Wilkinson offered to continue working on the hotel project for $650,000 through Oct. 15, 2003, and $75,000 a week after that. City Council members approved this deal, and on Dec. 13, 2003, paid Stevens & Wilkinson $697,084.79 \u2014 which lead Manning to write: \u201cThus the three tenants of contract have been established: offer, acceptance and valuable consideration.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 34.0007, "longitude": -81.0348}, {"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 34.0007, "longitude": -81.0348}, {"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 34.0007, "longitude": -81.0348}, {"name": "S.C.", "latitude": 34.0004, "longitude": -81.0001}, {"name": "S.C.", "latitude": 34.0004, "longitude": -81.0001}, {"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 34.0007, "longitude": -81.0348}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Restrictions in stores, offices and other places would remain at the owner\u2019s discretion. \u201cIt\u2019s the best we can get right now,\u201d council chairman Debbie Summers said. The plan quickly won approval from a County Council committee, setting the stage for ending a conflict that has persisted since fall. The nine-member council can take it up as soon as April 14. Some supporters say the proposal is the last attempt to break the standoff. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t make it, the deal is dead,\u201d Councilman Bill Banning said. But he expects narrow approval next month. Allowing smoking decks and patios is \u201ccreating miniature leper colonies,\u201d Councilman Todd Cullum said. All nearby communities with a ban allow that except for the town of Lexington. Mayor Randy Halfacre said he will seek to permit smoking decks and patios in his community if the new county plan for unincorporated areas is put into place. But town leaders will stick with their ban on smoking inside any workplace, he said. The new plan for county restrictions is \u201ca big step\u201d even though it is less than some advocates want, Halfacre said. The plan received a mixed reaction from one spokesman for the bar and restaurant industry. Bars and restaurants can live with a uniform ban, Tom Sponseller said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a level playing field, everyone gets treated the same, and there\u2019s no harm,\u201d he said. But he is concerned the exemption for private clubs could become either a loophole or a restriction so tight that it also bars smoking in country clubs and sites that nonprofit clubs operate for members.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Lexington County", "latitude": 33.9001, "longitude": -81.2998}, {"name": "Lexington County", "latitude": 33.9001, "longitude": -81.2998}, {"name": "Lexington", "latitude": 33.9815, "longitude": -81.2362}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

City Hall includes an entire floor dedicated to public space, with a 4,500- square- foot events hall available for conventions, receptions, and galas. Just steps from the events hall, City Park includes a large fountain timed to music, an amphitheater for public concerts and ceremonies, walking trails, a picnic shelter, a pond, and ample green space for family fun. The city's events staff keeps City Park the center of recreation in Greer, planning concerts and family festivals throughout the year.

John Banks, director of tourism with the West Metro Chamber of Commerce spoke on the various ways the chamber is promoting the area. Among other points, Banks said that special emphasis would be given to improving West Metro's brochures and encouraging business travelers to stay in West Columbia hotels. Additionally, Banks told council that the chamber was working to redesign its ads at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport. Banks said that a frequent complaint from visitors was that the ads at the airport were difficult to read. Banks added that the chamber would be promoting the West Columbia area's whitewater rafting opportunities. He reminded council that visitors can go whitewater rafting in the morning and see a play in Columbia that evening. Councilman Harley said he was particularly impressed with this idea. Banks also announced that the chamber was completely redesigning its website. Banks said that Splash Omnimedia of Lexington, South Carolina has been hired for the job.

Guests will most likely see them swimming around the exhibit or catching a ride on the back of one of their parents; you may have to look closely though, sometimes they tuck under their parents' wings for protection. This is the first set of offspring for the pair. The male, 9, came to Riverbanks in 2000 from the Santa Ana Zoo and the female, 5, came in 2004 from the Alexandria Zoo. Both animals are considered young parents, as swans can live into their 40s. The pair began nestbuilding in early January. The swans start by sitting on the ground and pulling organic material toward their bodies to build a nest up around them. The result is a conical- shaped shell.

Owens encouraged students that, despite the current economic climate, he believes the area of film and entertainment will continue to grow and there will be many new jobs generated by festivals. \u201cAs the distribution of cinema changes, film festivals are more important than ever for shedding light on works of unique and challenging cinema that most filmgoers don\u2019t get to see at the cineplex,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThere is a growing infrastructure being created to help young filmmakers and open new markets among people who like to make and watch movies on television, on the computer and in theaters.\u201d Nashville Film Festival Director Brian Owens, right, speaks with Stewart Lenig, head of the Columbia State Community College drama department, and CSCC student Trishae Dotson following his presentation at the college earlier this month.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 35.6151, "longitude": -87.0353}, {"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 35.6151, "longitude": -87.0353}, {"name": "Nashville", "latitude": 36.1659, "longitude": -86.7844}, {"name": "Nashville", "latitude": 36.1659, "longitude": -86.7844}, {"name": "Nashville", "latitude": 36.1659, "longitude": -86.7844}, {"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 35.6151, "longitude": -87.0353}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The state expects to receive $267 million to insulate, seal and otherwise improve home energy efficiency for thousands of low-income Ohioans over the next three years. Cole said the government spent less than that on weatherization programs for all 50 states last year. \"What we're being asked to do has never been done before,\" said Cole, who speaks for the anti-poverty organizations that will do most of the work. \"There's no pattern to follow.\" But there is an ideal path, which supporters describe in one-thing-leads-to-another terms: Agencies hire weatherization workers or contract with small businesses, creating jobs. They also buy trucks, insulation supplies, furnaces and water heaters, boosting the local economy. Residents' utility costs drop by an average of 30 percent, saving money and energy. Heating subsidies for the poor cost taxpayers less, and families spend the extra cash. \"This thing has so many opportunities for mischief and mismanagement,\" said Leslie Paige, spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste, a taxpayer watchdog organization based in Washington, D.C. \"It's very vulnerable to fraud.\" She said the pot is too large and the ramp-up time too short for small community-action agencies to manage. \"You're taking a sleepy little program and you're going to ram $5 billion at it, and on top of that you're going to say it has to be spent as quickly as possible,\" Paige said. \"It's a recipe for disaster.\" Some also question whether the program really can put more than 87,000 Americans to work, as President Barack Obama asserts. No one expects it to be easy, said Bill Graves of the Ohio Department of Development. Ohio received about $30 million in federal money for weatherization in 2008, so the stimulus money represents an increase of almost 800 percent. \"What are my worries? I wouldn't say worries; I'd say optimistic concerns,\" he said. \"This is a lot of money. It's a monumental task.\" Pat Williams says she's ready. As manager of the weatherization program at Impact Community Action Agency in Columbus, she could soon oversee a threefold increase in production. On a sunny, warm-for-March day last week, Williams had three crews of three working on drafty city homes. \"I'll have three more crews in the next few weeks,\" she said. \"When the stimulus hits, I plan to go to 16 to 20. This is going to make a tremendous difference in people's lives.\" Williams also is excited about the agency's ability to offer jobs with health insurance. She wants to hire as many people as possible, but Impact Executive Director Bo Chilton said the community-action agency doesn't want to create more positions than it can maintain. \"We'd hate to take on 30 new staff and then lay them off in two years,\" he said. \"So we'll probably be using contractors, too.\" Whether to create jobs or hire businesses can be a thorny issue for community-action agencies, most of whose missions include employment training. \"They're both legitimate business models,\" said Dave Rinebolt, executive director of Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, an umbrella group for energy-assistance groups. \"We anticipate plenty of jobs either way.\" Sean Babylon is thrilled to have one. The 32-year-old recently moved back to Columbus from Arkansas and badly wanted to return to Impact, where he had worked in weatherization before. He was surprised to learn that the agency could add employees. \"It's a big weight off my shoulders,\" Babylon said. \"I wake up and think, 'Wow. I have a job now.'\" Home weatherization as a public program has its roots in New England during the energy crisis of the 1970s, said Rinebolt, who first worked in Minnesota. He watched support wither during the next two decades and eventually lost his job to budget cuts. The coming boom is an about-face like nothing he has ever seen. About 7,000 low-income Ohio homes usually are weatherized each year at a maximum per-unit cost of about $3,900. With the stimulus money, the program could reach 26,000 homes a year at up to $6,500 each.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohioans", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Washington", "latitude": 38.8951, "longitude": -77.0364}, {"name": "D.C.", "latitude": 38.9171, "longitude": -77.0003}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 39.9612, "longitude": -82.9988}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 39.9612, "longitude": -82.9988}, {"name": "Arkansas", "latitude": 34.7504, "longitude": -92.5004}, {"name": "New England", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Ohio lawmakers voted almost completely in lockstep with their parties on a bill to provide billions of dollars for road projects, move forward with plans for passenger trains and toughen rules on drivers. Now they'll have to learn the art of the compromise. The House, controlled by Democrats, approved nearly all of Gov. Ted Strickland's two-year, $9.5 billion transportation budget, including controversial provisions green-lighting speed cameras in construction zones; a study of passenger rail service connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati; stronger enforcement of seat-belt laws; and solar- and wind-energy projects on the right-of-way along the Ohio Turnpike. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, wiped out nearly all of those provisions, although the train idea held on by a thread. Democrats say cameras to nab speeders in construction zones and enforcement of the seat-belt law as a primary offense meaning drivers can be ticketed even if it's their only violation will enhance public safety. Republicans say the changes are about money and infringe on personal freedom. Democrats say the rail plan would provide a new transportation option for Ohioans and stimulate economic development. Many Republicans say the idea hasn't been adequately researched and may not find enough riders. Democrats say the state owns plenty of unused land along the turnpike that could generate green energy. Republicans say the idea was too ill-defined for them to approve. Those disputes, and dozens of smaller differences between the House and Senate bills, now go to a bipartisan, six-member conference committee to iron out the differences. The committee is tasked with developing a final bill that both chambers will either accept or reject. Though once used regularly, conference committees became a far rarer occurrence in the past decade-plus, as members of the Republican-controlled legislature grew to view the committees as a failure of compromise. But with a new Democratic-controlled House and GOP-run Senate for the first time in 16 years, the conference committee should see a resurgence. \"As a leader, you kind of want a bill to go conference committee because you have more control over it,\" said Sen. Jon Husted, a Kettering Republican who served four years as House speaker. The conference committee is scheduled to do its work today, Wednesday and Thursday if needed. It won't have time to dawdle: Strickland must sign the final compromise bill by March 31. The budget is for the 2010-11 fiscal years, which begin July 1, and the legislation doesn't take effect for 90 days. Conceivably, the conference committee could strip out the more controversial provisions such as the new driver rules and move forward on the rest of the bill. Scott Varner, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, said it's been at least a quarter-century since the agency's budget wasn't approved by the March 31 deadline. Herb Asher, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University, said he doesn't expect partisan wrangling to doom the transportation budget this year. \"You can't have endless stalemate,\" he said. \"Transportation is very important to the state, very important to the economy.\" There could be horse-trading on some of the items; for example, Republicans could yield on the speed cameras in exchange for Democrats dumping the seat-belt provision. But Asher said it doesn't have to be that simple. \"Conference committees have a substantial amount of power,\" he said. \"You don't have to split the difference.\" Husted said it remains unknown how the new Statehouse political dynamics will play out. House Speaker Armond Budish, D-Beachwood, is new to the process and veteran Senate President Bill M. Harris, R-Ashland, has been out of Columbus for weeks with a badly broken leg. \"What does happen will foreshadow how problems are solved with the operating budget, which is a far bigger issue,\" Husted said of that $54.4 billion two-year spending plan, which will be decided in June.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Cleveland", "latitude": 41.4995, "longitude": -81.6954}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 39.9612, "longitude": -82.9988}, {"name": "Dayton", "latitude": 39.7589, "longitude": -84.1916}, {"name": "Cincinnati", "latitude": 39.162, "longitude": -84.4569}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Kettering", "latitude": 39.6895, "longitude": -84.1688}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Beachwood", "latitude": 41.4645, "longitude": -81.5087}, {"name": "Ashland", "latitude": 40.8687, "longitude": -82.3182}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 39.9612, "longitude": -82.9988}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The county operates 157 of them, but coverage remains spotty in the southeast and southwest corners. An additional 17 sirens are scheduled to be installed in Columbus, Pleasant Township, Madison Township and Grove City this year. No one knows exactly how many sirens the county needs, but one planning document allows for 200, said Michael R. Pannell, the county's director of emergency management and homeland security. Individual jurisdictions are responsible for buying the sirens, and the county handles their operation. Pleasant and Madison townships both used a three-year, no-interest loan program through the county to buy the $20,000 sirens. Dublin operates its own sirens and is fully covered with 24, said Michael Racey, a city spokesman. Wednesday's statewide drill is largely meant to prepare Ohioans for tornado season, which runs from April through July, according to the state's Emergency Management Agency. While the sirens go off, alerts will be broadcast on television and radio. State officials say they hope that schools, businesses and families will practice their disaster plans. That's part of the reason the drill is scheduled for 9:50 a.m., said Kelli Blackwell, a spokeswoman for the state agency. People will be at work and school, where they can practice. It also avoids conflicts with broadcasters who have news updates at the top of the hour. Franklin County typically tests its sirens at noon on Wednesdays.

A state law on the books since 1980 requires agencies to set aside 15 percent of purchases for bidding by minority-owned businesses only. But total spending with minority companies in fiscal year 2008 was 3 percent of $2.3 billion. Purchases from companies participating in the Encouraging Diversity, Growth and Equity program, or EDGE, totaled 2.1 percent last year - while the goal in the state's administrative code since 2004 is 5 percent. \"These numbers are staggering,\" said state Sen. Ray Miller, D-Columbus, a vocal advocate of compliance with minority-business participation goals. \"It's unacceptable.\" Gov. Ted Strickland required the scorecard for the first time as part of an executive order he issued last June that sought better participation in the state's Minority Business Enterprise and EDGE programs. The idea was that requiring an annual measurement would spur better compliance, and the governor ordered other steps such as requiring each state agency to appoint an officer to monitor compliance. The scorecard for the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, showed that only one of 22 cabinet agencies met the 15 percent spending goal for minority-owned businesses. Of the 12 reporting state colleges and universities, two met the goal, while six of the 58 state boards and commissions were in compliance. \"The governor expects to see improvement in the future,\" spokeswoman Amanda Wurst said. \"This scorecard certainly will provide us a baseline for improvements.\" Ron Sylvester, a spokesman for the Department of Administrative Services, said the state is working with agencies to identify missed opportunities for using minority or disadvantaged vendors and to find new vendors if necessary. State law says that if no bid is submitted by a minority-owned business for contracts set aside for such companies, the purchase is made according to usual procedures. Miller argued that the state must aggressively market opportunities to minority and disadvantaged companies, streamline the certification process for them and encourage majority contractors to subcontract with them. \"We should see some change because I am certain the governor is going to give this the highest priority and strongly encourage his cabinet and all other agencies of state government to do much better than they have in the past,\" he said. Various statements have been made in previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, about the need to increase contracts and state jobs for minorities. Paul Mifsud, the late chief of staff for former Gov. George V. Voinovich, even said in 1995 that the Cleveland Republican \"is a guy that lives and breathes equity\" and is committed to affirmative action \"every day of the year.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 39.9612, "longitude": -82.9988}, {"name": "Cleveland", "latitude": 41.4995, "longitude": -81.6954}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Annika Jones quickly drifts off to sleep Saturday. Nestled in her mother\u2019s arms, content from having just finished a bottle, she sighs softly as she naps. Kristina and Tim Jones, both 27, refer to 9-month-old Annika as their \u201clittle miracle.\u201d The couple lost their first child, Hailey, in May 2006 just 15 minutes after she was born during Kristina\u2019s 26th week of pregnancy. Two miscarriages followed before Annika was born June 13. \u201cI don\u2019t think, up until the day I went to the hospital, that I would go in and have a C-section and come home with a baby,\u201d Kristina said. The Jones family is this year\u2019s am bas sador family for the March for Babies in DeKalb County. A fundraiser for the March of Dimes, it will be held April 25 in Hopkins Park in DeKalb. The county\u2019s walk raised more than $54,000 last year, and Lisa Kijowski, chairwoman of the March for Babies of DeKalb County, would like to exceed that this year. The March of Dimes is a nonprofit that works to improve the health of babies through research and education. Its goals are to prevent birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality, according to the organization\u2019s Web site. An estimated half-million babies are born premature annually in the country, according to March of Dimes. The Jones family said the organization has provided support and information to them, and they lauded the group for the funding it provides for research and educational efforts. This is the third year they have taken part in the local walk. Team Hailey, which consists of about 30 friends and family members, has raised a combined $13,000 during those three years for the March of Dimes. They accepted the role of 2009 ambassador family for the local walk so they should share their story, Tim said. \u201cMore often, you hear the good stories, where the baby survived,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t as fortunate. But it\u2019s a story that people need to hear because it does happen.\u201d Kijowski said the ambassador family usually is \u201csomeone who has been truly touched\u201d and has a direct connection with the March of Dimes. \u201cI think people have a tendency to forget when there is not the sight of a physical family or babies there to share their story,\u201d Kijowski said. \u201cUsually, when the ambassador family has shared their story, there\u2019s not a dry eye in the house.\u201d The Joneses\u2019 story starts with Hailey, who was born with Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, a heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is abnormally formed. The tricuspid valve normally has three \u201cflaps,\u201d or leaflets, according to the American Heart Association. With Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, one or two flaps are stuck to the wall of the heart. Kristina had gone to the doctor because she hadn\u2019t felt Hailey move much; after an ultrasound, the doctor told the Joneses that the baby was in distress and needed to be born immediately through a Caesarean section. At 26 weeks, Hailey had a 40 percent chance of survival. Tim and Kristina said they were in shock at the news. When a pediatrician told them there would be some decisions to make after the birth, \u201cwe both knew what that meant,\u201d Kristina said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think we had time to think. It went really fast,\u201d Kristina recalled. \u201cShe lived 15 minutes. That\u2019s it.\u201d Tim and family members were told first; Tim told Kristina when she awoke after surgery. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we went through it,\u201d Kristina said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re here smiling. It\u2019s unnatural. Parents aren\u2019t supposed to see their child die.\u201d Doctors advised Kristina and Tim to wait a year before trying to have another child, which they said was hard but gave them time to grieve. Frequent visits with doctors and specialists led to Annika\u2019s birth last year. Hailey is never far from their minds, Kristina said, and being able to help other babies in her name is an honor. \u201cWe can raise this money for other babies, so when other babies are born at 26 weeks with a heart condition, one day, none of them dies,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our passion. We don\u2019t want to see families go through what we went through.\u201d March for Babies For information about the March for Babies in DeKalb County, call Lisa Kijowski at 815-899-5743.

MALTA \u2013 About 5,000 books are stacked on, under and around tables near the entrance to the Kishwaukee College library, separated into subjects as diverse as those on the library shelves \u2013 job search, self-help, textbooks, encyclopedias and a small mountain of paperback fiction. \"We've been getting donations throughout the year and discarding throughout the year, and we had a book drive about a month ago,\" library staffer Mary Middleton said. \"A lot are related to the degrees and programs we have here at the college, and we got a lot of fiction donations.\" And those thousands of books are available for purchase this week during the library's annual book sale. Paperbacks in the sale are priced at 50 cents and hardcover books at $1. The proceeds from the sale will help the library to purchase new books and materials, Middleton said. When deciding which books to discard, the library staff consider the condition of the book and the number of titles on the shelf with the same subject, she said. They also consider the age of the information. While the information contained in art books never expires, she said, computer or political science texts can become obsolete. \"We try to keep the library updated with relevant information,\" Middleton said. Some of the most desirable books were snapped up early by used book dealers waiting outside the door when the library opened Monday, Middleton said. The books that don't sell by the time the event ends Saturday will either be set out on tables for students to take for free or will be sent to an online used book distributor for sale, she said. Though the annual book sale has been going on since 2004, it's not the only opportunity to get a deal on the library's used books, Middleton added. A section of shelves on the library's second floor is filled with books that are always on sale, she said. \"That sale goes on year round, so if someone misses the book sale, they might want to come check that out,\" she said.

The two candidates running for Kirkland president have one thing in common: Both have held the office before. Incumbent Mike Becker is facing village trustee Les Bellah in the April 7 election for village president. Bellah was village president from 1996-2004. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed sitting at that part of the table and interfacing with people, with business owners, on the one-on-one basis,\u201d Bellah said Monday when asked why he wanted to run for village president again. \u201cThose people look for some guidance and leadership and I feel like I provide both.\u201d Becker has been president for the past four years and said he wants to continue doing a job he enjoys. He described himself as \u201ca little more cautious or conservative,\u201d traits he said are beneficial for an elected official to have. \u201cSometimes decisions are made in a quick manner or are looking for cheapest solution and that may or may not be the best solution,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to look into and understand each issue totally before developing a solution for it.\u201d If elected, Becker said he would focus on the city\u2019s economic survival. He would ensure the village \u201cmaintains community services within our limits during tough economic times.\u201d It will be tough, he said, because he doesn\u2019t expect the village\u2019s revenue to increase much in the near future. \u201cI\u2019m not not sure how we do that. We have to keep a very careful eye on what we spend and how we spend it, and make the most that we can with our money,\u201d he said. Bellah said he would focus on spending as well, but said he would provide \u201clittle or no compromise\u201d on keeping the police and public works departments well staffed because both are needed to ensure public safety. He advocated for expanding neighborhood watch programs to \u201clet the people be the eyes and the ears of the police department.\u201d And he said he would ask residents to support local businesses, noting many leave the village to shop elsewhere. Bellah said he would go door-to-door to talk to residents about that, or hold town meetings were shopkeepers could talk to residents about their struggles to stay afloat. A priority for Becker would be to examine options for the village\u2019s wastewater treatment plant. The existing plant is \u201cgetting near the end of its life term,\u201d he said, and the village needs to consider methods of replacing it. \u201cGiven these times, I\u2019m not sure we can do it,\u201d Becker said, adding he would recommend the village seek federal funding for assistance. At the very least, he said, they need to start planning for a new one. Another priority for Bellah is enforcement of traffic laws in the village. Many motorists traveling on Route 72 through the village exceed the speed limit, which is 35 miles per hour coming into and leaving town, and 30 in the village, he said. \u201cThe trucks speed through extremely fast, and people are running stop signs,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they think the word \u2018Stop\u2019 means.\u201d Both men said they would be a good fit for the job. \u201cKirkland is my home. I really care deeply about what goes on in the community,\u201d Becker said. \u201cIn the years I\u2019ve been on the village board, residents know they can come to me with a problem and I will try to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Bellah said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Kirkland", "latitude": 42.0925, "longitude": -88.8512}, {"name": "Kirkland", "latitude": 42.0925, "longitude": -88.8512}, {"name": "Kirkland", "latitude": 42.0925, "longitude": -88.8512}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

DeKALB \u2013 Residents in the city\u2019s fourth ward might soon be getting a knock on their door and an invitation to clean up. A pilot program that aims to tidy DeKalb neighborhoods was unanimously approved by the DeKalb City Council Monday. The Neighborhood Improvement Coordination Effort, or NICE program, will kick off during NIU Cares Day \u2013 a day devoted to performing volunteer work in the community \u2013 which is April 18 this year. Northern Illinois University students volunteering that day would be enlisted to clean up participating properties along public alleys and streets in the area between Fourth and Seventh streets bounded by Culver and Charter streets. This area was chosen because it contains alleys that have long been neglected, Public Works Director Rick Monas said. Jamie Smirz, the city\u2019s special projects coordinator, said the goal is to get different programs to work together as one. \u201cWe have a lot of programs that the city already offers that we will be basically educating the neighborhood about,\u201d Smirz said. \u201cIt really is an extension of our rehab program.\u201d Rather than trying to combat property maintenance issues through strict code enforcement, NICE would encourage residents to take part in rehab programs, like the city\u2019s partnership with the DeKalb Lowe\u2019s store.

A body found this weekend in the Kishwaukee River was identified Monday as that of a Wisconsin man last seen Christmas Day in DeKalb. The body of 56-year-old James C. Verduin was found about 2:45 p.m. Sunday in the river near Hopkins Park in DeKalb. Verduin was identified Monday during an autopsy, DeKalb County Coroner Dennis Miller said. Preliminary autopsy results show Verduin, a father of two from West Allis, Wis., drowned, Miller said. \u201cWe don\u2019t suspect any foul play,\u201d Miller said, adding there were no wounds, bruises or other marks on the body. \u201cThere was no sign of a struggle.\u201d Miller said Verduin probably died Christmas Day or Dec. 26, and has been in the river since then. A couple walking their dog Sunday afternoon in Hopkins Park noticed the body floating face up in the water behind the 200 block of Joanne Lane, according to police reports. Police do not know where Verduin entered the water. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with rivers, currents can certainly have a huge effect on where you\u2019re going to find an object,\u201d DeKalb Police Lt. Gary Spangler said. \u201cHe could have went into the river 100 yards of where we found him, he could have gone in by the hotel. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d Verduin\u2019s body might have been stuck on something in the river, Spangler and Miller said, which is why it hadn\u2019t been found until now. If that was the case, recent heavy rainfalls caused the river to swell and could have dislodged him, Spangler said. Authorities believe Verduin wandered into the river, Spangler said. \u201cWe are aware of some emotional issues that could have contributed to the death,\u201d he added. The body of Verduin, who was found wearing only boxer shorts, was discolored but intact, according to police reports. Verduin \u201cmore than likely discarded the clothing before or while in the water,\u201d Spangler said, but added that the clothing has not been found. Verduin was expected to attend a family gathering Dec. 27, but left a message for his family that he needed some time away by himself, his brother, Bill Verduin, told the Daily Chronicle in January. The family is not sure why he was in the DeKalb area on Christmas Day, when he was involved in a one-car accident on Interstate 88. Verduin declined treatment at the scene of the accident, according to police reports, but appeared a bit disoriented by people he came in contact with after the accident. Miller said Verduin showed no signs of head trauma. His family has said Verduin had diabetes. After his car crashed into a tollway truss, it was towed from the scene, and the tow truck driver dropped Verduin off at the Best Western DeKalb Inn & Suites, police said. Two days later, a hotel employee called Verduin\u2019s family and asked them to pick up his belongings, noting that he had never checked out. The family called police, who searched the area around the hotel that night, police said. Several additional air and ground searches were conducted in the days and weeks following his disappearance.

Her last day in the Dublin post was Sept. 26, 2008. The national search for a new city manager began Sept. 8, when City Council unanimously approved a motion to engage the services of Thomas Dority Sr., vice president of the Mercer Group, for the recruitment process. The result was the appointment of Terry Foegler as Dublin's city manager, and his first official day of work was Feb. 17. \"This discussion is important, but we have had to go to a second tier of consideration,\" Chinnici-Zuercher said, as she suggested council members discuss the commission issue in a committee of the whole meeting to be scheduled before September. \"It clearly needs to be discussed,\" Keenan said. Following City Council's disapproval of the motion to exclude the planning and zoning seat from the appointments, it unanimously approved the following appointments:* Chris Amorose Groomes and Flite Freimann, four-year terms on the Planning and Zoning Commission, expiring March 31, 2013. * Carl Karrer, three-year term on the Architectural Review Board as the Dublin Historical Society representative, and Robert Schisler, three-year term on the ARB as an Historic District merchant representative. Both terms expire March 31, 2012. * Victoria Newell and Brett Page, a three-year term for each on the Board of Zoning Appeals, expiring March 31, 2012. * Patrick Todoran, to the unexpired term of Keith Blosser on the Board of Zoning Appeals, a term which expires on March 31, 2010. * Christine Gawronski and Dona Givens, both reappointed to a three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring March 31, 2012. * Kevin Cooper, three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring on March 31, 2012. * Susan Burness, three-year term as the city representative to the Dublin Convention and Visitors Bureau Board, a term which expires on March 31, 2012. * Jamie Boff and David Cecutti, reappointed to three-year terms on the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission, expiring March 31, 2012. * DeWayne Howard, three-year term on the Personnel Board of Review, a term which expires on March 31, 2012. \"I do not wish to vote 'no,' because of the balance of those folks who have been appointed,\" Lecklider said, as he cast his 'yes' vote. There is one remaining appointment to be made to the Architectural Review Board, and City Council hopes to complete this appointment at its April 6 meeting, Clerk of Council Anne Clarke said via e-mail Tuesday, March 17. Board and commission members will have an orientation and training session at 6:30 p.m. Monday, March 30 in Talla 2 at the Dublin Community Recreation Center, 5600 Post Road, Chinnici-Zuercher said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

It may have seemed, at times, like it might never get there, but the Dublin Veterans Project is moving closer to its fundraising and dedication goal. \"We are 80 percent to our goal,\" project committee member Michael Kehoe said during Dublin City Council's regular session Monday, March 16. The committee has raised nearly $612,000 toward its goal of $790,000, he said, with eight of 25 trees designated in the sycamore grove section of the memorial. In 2006, Dublin City Council committed $250,000 to the project, with another $250,000 in funds to be raised by the Veterans Project fundraising committee. At the time, plans proposed to have the completed project's dedication on Veterans Day in 2007. But the project ran into obstacles when city staff learned in July 2007 that the total construction cost for the Grounds of Remembrance memorial was approaching, if not exceeding, $800,000. The cost overrun resulted in the Veterans Project committee unanimously approving a motion to allow project design firm Plant Architect Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada a second chance to come back to the committee with a design for the Grounds of Remembrance project that would meet the original $500,000 budget. The project was designed to include an entry sign, a copper clad loggia, a memory wall, a dedication wall, walking path and associated site work, according to information from the city. City Council unanimously approved a resolution accepting a base bid of $478,840 from the McDaniel Construction Corp. as the lowest and best bid for the project in August 2008 and construction began shortly after. The project committee has a fundraiser, the Red, White and Blue Bash, scheduled for 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. May 1 at the Villas at Coffman Park, Kehoe said. Tickets are $300 each and include a dedication stone, he said. \"If they have already purchased a stone, we will offer another option,\" he said. The dedication of Grounds of Remembrance in Dublin Veterans Park is on track to take place Memorial Day, Monday, May 25, \"following the parade led by the VFW and American Legion,\" Kehoe said. \"You have all done an incredible job raising the funds and increasing awareness of this very important memorial,\" Dublin Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher said. In other council business, legislation was approved authorizing the city to enter into a pre-annexation agreement for 5,600 acres on the east side of Hyland-Croy Road at 8600 Hyland-Croy Road in Jerome Township, in order to obtain city water and sewer services. Legislation amending the annual appropriations ordinance for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2009, also was approved. In addition, council approved a resolution allowing the city to enter into an agreement allowing the operation of a Subway restaurant in the Dublin Community Recreation Center. The city previously had a lease agreement with TehKu Tea Co. TehKu ceased operations at the center in August 2008 due to its inability to prosper, according to information from the city. \"We learned a lot from that experience,\" Dublin Recreation Services Director Matt Earman said. Following a patron survey conducted by city staff, Subway was found to meet the primary criteria of providing prompt service for all menu options, a variety of healthy food options, and a business strategy with proven success inside a recreation center similar to the DCRC -- the Natatorium in Cuyahoga Falls, he said. The estimated timeframe for full operation at the DCRC is eight to 12 weeks, according to information from the city. The center's restaurant will include breakfast sandwiches as well as the full Subway menu.

Students from several Dublin elementary schools don't have to rely on action television shows to get a dose of martial arts before school in the morning. Instead they come to school early to study with Master Greg Fears, a retired police officer and veteran competitor on the world martial arts stage. Fears teaches children and adults at the Ernie Reyes' World Martial Arts School in Carriage Place, but he said coming to the schools to work with students is a welcome addition. \"It's refreshing -- just to know that you can have an impact in their lives,\" he said. Fears' classes at Glacier Ridge, Deer Run and Thomas elementary schools emphasize more than kicks and punches. He also tries to reinforce what parents are teaching their kids, he said, including respect and life skills. \"When you hear it from more than one person, it ends up sinking in,\" he said. Glacier Ridge third-grader Adam Alkire said Fears taught his class \"that we're to help people and not start fights. \"Alkire just completed his third four-week session with Fears and earned his Little Dragon Red Belt. Allison Jennings is also a third-grader at Glacier Ridge. She said Fears taught her and her classmates that respect and concentration are important. Jennings put her concentration to good use to break a board into three pieces with her hand at the conclusion of the final class. \"I was, like, amazed,\" she said about the two breaks she made in the board. Each of the 18 students in the Glacier Ridge class took on -- and broke -- the board, with family members looking on and classmates watching in respectful silence. Fears said each student had to choose whether or not to try to break the board. \"You feel more confident that you've overcome that obstacle,\" he said. \"The point is not to see if you can break the board,\" he told students. \"The point is to empower yourself. \"Students kept the pieces of their broken boards, as well as their new colored belts. The martial arts clubs are open to elementary school students of all ages, said Heather Heinz, the Glacier Ridge PTO martial arts coordinator. Glacier Ridge offers the program twice per year. The club helps students by introducing them to the world of martial arts, providing a means of self-defense and developing self-confidence and character, Heinz said. It also offers physical benefits, including enhancing conditioning, flexibility, agility and coordination, she said. Fears said the Thomas club still had three weeks remaining in its current session, and then the clubs will be finished for the current school year.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Dublin", "latitude": 40.0992, "longitude": -83.1141}, {"name": "Carriage Place", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Wichita Street or Wichita Drive? Dublin City Council heard a first reading on legislation to change the name of the street during its regular meeting Monday, March 16. Dublin Director of Engineering Paul Hammersmith said a discrepancy in what residents believe is the street name after it was brought to the attention of city staff by the Franklin County Auditor's Office. The city issued addresses for Wichita Street Dec. 16, 1986. Records indicate the majority of residents are using Wichita Drive instead of Wichita Street, according to information from the city. \"We think the developer installed street signs showing Wichita Drive, and that the posted sign is why the residents use 'Drive' instead of 'Street,' \" Hammersmith said. \"Folks moved in, started using Wichita Drive and that is where we are at today,\" he said. Hammersmith said letters were sent to the nine residents regarding the change, and that city staff has not heard back from them. \"The post office and 9-1-1 said everybody is using Wichita Drive,\" he said. \"It should be a simple change, which we will take care of at out next meeting,\" April 6, Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher said. Council also heard a first reading of legislation to change the name of a section of Darby Street in Historic Dublin to North Street. Darby Street currently originates on Bridge Street between the Dublin Veterinary Clinic, 32 W. Bridge St., and the BriHi site, and ends on High Street, south of the Dublin Branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, 75 N. High St.Proceeding north on Darby from Bridge Street, Darby Street makes a 90-degree turn to the east in front of the library, and causes confusion because the street intersects both Bridge and High Streets and runs both north-south and east-west, according to information from the city. \"We know this is actually called Darby Street, and that is part of the problem,\" Hammersmith said. Changing the name of the section running east-west in front of the library from Darby to North Street will also help meet one of the goals of the Historic Dublin wayfaring project -- to make visitors comfortable and confident while visiting the district, according to information from the city. Both the city and engineering departments support the change, there are no addresses to be renamed, and the library and the Blarney Brothers Ltd., adjoining property owners, have not expressed concerns regarding the proposed change. \"Some things do work in our favor,\" Hammersmith said.

Frank Buck Zoo is inviting all of its friends, new and old, to join them in celebrating Frank \u201cBring \u2018Em Back Alive\u201d Buck\u2019s birthday on March 17. Frank Howard Buck was born in Gainesville on March 17, 1884. As a child Buck was fascinated by all kinds of animals and loved to study school geography books filled with exotic names of far-off places, said Frank Buck Zoo Director Susan Kleven in an e-mail sent to the Register. In 1911, she added, Buck began his 24 year career in the business of collecting animals for exhibit. \u201cAt a time when \u2018big game hunting\u2019 abroad was a popular pastime of the wealthy, Frank Buck concentrated on capturing and preserving the world\u2019s wildlife,\u201d said Kleven. \u201cBuck abhorred the senseless slaughter of animals. His efforts play a large role in making American\u2019s aware of how important it is to conserve the vast treasure that is our native wildlife. \u201d\u201cDuring his career, Buck placed many animals into environments in which they could breed and propagate without the threat of extinction. Thus, Frank Buck was one of the first wildlife conservationist at a time when conservation was a sadly neglected matter.\u201d In honor of Buck\u2019s birthday, zoo admission will be a buck a head ($1) during Tuesday, March 17 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.Visitors will also be able to explore the world\u2019s only Frank Buck Exhibit located in the zoo\u2019s gift shop.

He\u2019s a long way from home. His arms are aching and a warm shower would feel good. But Kevin George Baker can\u2019t complain. His mission is at stake. Sipping a Sprite during a stop at Gainesville\u2019s VFW Post No. 1922,, Baker, almost 40, talked about his plan to ride a bicycle from his hometown of Norman, Okla. to Washington D.C.Peddling a custom built hand crank bicycle, the disabled Gulf War veteran knew he would be among friends when he saw Gainesville VFW Post No. 1922 in the distance. \u201cI saw the VFW and I thought, \u201cThank God,\u201d Baker said. The purpose of his journey is simple. He\u2019d like to deliver an Honor and Remember flag to President Barack Obama. Honor and Remember is a nationwide project to bring recognition to American veterans. The organization\u2019s mission is, according to its Web site, \u201cto establish and promote a nationally recognized flag that would fly continuously as a visible reminder to all Americans of the lives lost in defense of our national freedoms. All Military lives lost not only in action but also in service, from our nation's inception.\u201d Baker doesn\u2019t have an invitation to visit the White House, but hopes the president will allow him inside, just for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m hoping President Obama will open the gates for me,\u201d Baker said, smiling. He\u2019s a likable guy who looks younger than he is. He\u2019s quick to talk about his progress and even quicker to listen to the words of others. He never gets tired of telling strangers why he\u2019s riding a bike to D.C.And strangers like to talk to him. Most have one main concern \u2014 Baker\u2019s safety. \u201cThey ask me if I\u2019m all right,\u201d he said. Baker is not easy to miss with his trio of flags -- an American flag, a Soldier\u2019s Angels flag and an Honor and Remember flag and his belongings strapped neatly to his bicycle and small bike trailer. It isn\u2019t easy to peddle the custom built bicycle, especially for a man with a disability. An enemy attack while serving in a naval firefighting unit in the first Gulf War left him with severe neurological damage. As a result, he can stand only with assistance. But using his shoulders, arms and hands he can peddle a bike like nobody\u2019s business. \u201cI may end up looking like the Incredible Hulk when I get back,\u201d Baker said, \u201cAll that upper body strength.\u201d He got the idea to start his journey during a tough time in his life. He was battling cancer -- a result, he said, of Gulf War syndrome, a set of troubling symptoms which include neurological disorders and several types of cancer. The U.S. Defense Department denies the existence of Gulf War syndrome but Baker is certain his time in Iraq, breathing the contaminated air from hundreds of Saddam Hussein\u2018s burning oil facilities, caused his cancer. The disease may even be the reason Baker chose to make the trip. \u201cIn December, I was going through chemo and I thought this might be the last time I can do something like this so I may as well try it,\u201d he said. He left his Norman home Saturday, March 7 according to www.honorandremember.org.His plan on Monday was to stop for a while in Gainesville before heading on to Sherman where he had decided to spend the night in a camp ground. Baker brought along the things he figured he would require during the 15-week trip -- about 150 pounds of gear including camping supplies. He tries to plan his stops so that he ends up at public campgrounds. Other times, he stays at hotels or motels. On a good day with calm winds and fair weather, he said he can do 50 miles a day. Some days, like Monday, are more difficult with relentless winds that make peddling a challenge. \u201cI was lucky to get 40 miles in today,\u201d he said. He\u2019s also met some kindred spirits on the trip. \u201cMy first day out, I peddled 48 miles and was through for the day. I stopped at a Shell gas station where I met a husband and wife. They were both veterans, and they ended up asking me to stay the night with them,\u201d he said. He admits the ride to Washington is one of the greatest challenges of his life. Baker said he isn\u2019t even sure he\u2019ll make it the entire 1,500 miles. \u201cI\u2019m not thoroughly sure I can do this, but I tell myself every day that I can and so far, I\u2019ve kept on going,\u201d he said. He isn\u2019t afraid he\u2019ll become too ill to continue the ride, he said. \u201cRiding this bicycle makes me feel stronger. I\u2019ve been sick for 11 years, but I\u2019m gonna be okay,\u201d he said. Baker said he isn\u2019t riding for his own recognition. He\u2019s riding for all the men and women who have fought and are still fighting in wars that most people don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about. And there\u2019s another, more basic reason for his ride. \u201cI love my country,\u201d he said.

TxDOT reportedly approved a request to fund an overpass running east and west over Farm to Market 678 on U.S. Highway 82, said Commissioner Gary Hollowell. Hollowell said the resolution is the combined efforts of a number of concerned citizens as well as members of the commissioners court. A group of commissioners wrote the resolution and presented it to TxDOT at least two years ago, Hollowell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve attended meetings at (TxDOT\u2019s district office) in Wichita Falls where we met with a nonbinding resolution committee. We provided TxDOT with a wish list of projects we would like to see completed. The list is prioritized, but TxDOT is not obligated to do it (the projects),\u201d he said. He said county judges and representatives of municipalities often appeal for projects they believe are important. The overpass at 678 was apparently a priority for many, Hollowell said, citing efforts by county commissioners, Cooke County residents and others including Callisburg Independent School District Superintendent Dr. Charles Holloway to get the project started. \u201cThe justification for the project are the accidents and near-accidents at this intersection,\u201d he said. The project is also the result of investigation and research by TxDOT officials. \u201cTxDOT spent time doing traffic studies and installing warning indicators (at the intersection),\u201d he said. \u201cThey also increased the number of turn lanes and added exceleration lanes and striping to try to highlight the area.\u201d The project is not scheduled to begin immediately. \u201cWe think it will be let in 2010 or 2012,\u201d Hollowell said.

Mom\u2019s Donut owner Cindy Davidson \u2014 who operates the donut business with her husband, Chris \u2014 said things haven\u2019t been all good, but they are not dismal. \u201cJanuary was real rough,\u201d Davidson said in a telephone interview Friday, \u201cJanuary is always a rough time for us because people are dieting and have spent a lot of money at Christmas, but things are picking up. This week which was spring break has been real good.

Some business owners choose to improve the look of their stores. Gainesville\u2019s Tom Thumb supermarket, which is owned by the California-based Safeway corporation, recently revamped its store on Grand Avenue. The changes are part of the company\u2019s plan to make shopping a bit easier for customers, said Connie Yates a spokesman for the company. The renovated Tom Thumb store was set up using the company\u2019s lifestyle concept, she noted. \u201cWe are in the process of remodeling all of our stores in Texas to have the lifestyles format,\u201d she said. The store is organized in more a customer-friendly way with lots of similar items grouped together. \u201cWe want to have one-stop shopping for our customers in an atmosphere that they can enjoy shopping in,\u201d she said. The store renovations are part of that plan. \u201cWe are very proud of our newly remodeled store in Gainesville and are doing everything we can using special sales and discount opportunities for our customers.\u201d Food is one requirement that cannot be ignored, she said. \u201cI have heard the grocery industry referred to as an essential industry. People have to eat,\u201d Yates said. A handful of Gainesville companies chose to settle in new locations. Curves, a local fitness facility, is set to move to a new office complex on Grand Avenue. Owner Judy Waskow said after some difficult times late last year, her company seems to be recovering quickly. \u201cThe end of the year was not good at all,\u201d Waskow admitted. \u201cBut January and February have started out well.\u201d She said although the move to the new building was essential \u2014 the building where Curves is located was sold over a year ago \u2014 the new location is a larger facility which she believes both current and future members will enjoy. Working out is a passion for many residents, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a good bunch (of members) that work out regularly,\u201d she said. She also said the economic picture isn\u2019t perfect, but it isn\u2019t all bleak. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d she said. Another Gainesville business set to move to new, larger digs is Landmark Bank. Landmark Bank Chief Executive Officer Basil Bigbie said the company has experienced \u201csteady growth in the north central Texas (Texoma) area. \u201d\u201cProviding our customers with access to new facilities along the Highway 82 corridor east into Gainesville and Lindsay was a natural progression for the bank,\u201d Bigbie said in an e-mail message. He also said the decision to open new facilities in this area came after a lot of thought and preparation. \u201cThe planning, strategy and allocation of resources for these two facilities was in place well before the recent economic events. We\u2019re excited to be moving forward with these two new banking centers and have already received a lot of positive feedback from the Gainesville and Lindsay communities,\u201d Bigbie noted. Local automobile dealerships faced a year when most major auto manufacturers reported huge losses. But a representative for one Gainesville-area dealership said business is not bad at all. Glenn Polk AutoPlex is posting sales and service numbers that are equal to 2007, which, a press release says, was a fantastic year. They attribute their success to repeat and referral business. \u201cAlthough lot traffic has slowed a bit, we still have a steady stream of our previous customers coming in, and referrals of their friends and relatives,\u201d said owner Glenn Polk. \u201cNot only are we proud of our hard work and the success that we have had in Cooke County, but we are proud to be a part of the American auto industry. We are excited to be a part of Ford Motor Company and Chrysler,\u201d Polk added. According to Polk\u2019s son, Trent, the company also employees approximately 60 people and has contributed almost $200,000 in donations, fundraisers and sponsorships. \u201cGlenn Polk AutoPlex averages between 125-150 new and used vehicle sales every month. Since opening in April of 1995, we have sold over 22,000 here in Gainesville. These kinds of numbers are equal to dealerships you\u2019d find in a big city,\u201d Trent Polk said. Like other business owners, the Polks said they encourage residents to shop local businesses. \u201cWe encourage folks to do business local. Keeping the money here in Gainesville is very important to the growth of our community,\u201d Trent Polk concluded. Auto dealer James Wood is another businessman who sees the potential in Gainesville. Wood recently made a deal to purchase Brown Motor Company. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking to put in a finance lot in Gainesville because it\u2019s such a good trade area,\u201d Wood said in a March 4 Register story.

Kinney donned his leather flying helmet, taxied up the runway and then flew over the airport several times before tipping the aircraft wings several times in salute, and roaring off toward his destinaiton. CBS was one of the main sponsors for the renovation of the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk, the plane made famous in WW II. Kinney said \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with aviation all my life. On Jan. 19, 1967, right after I graduated from North Texas, I went straight to the airport and bought some aviation lessons. \u201d\u201cI was in the Navy flying aircraft after submarines in early Vietnam,\u201d said Kinney. \u201cFor me, this is just about as good as it gets, flying the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk.\u201d said KinneyThe U.S. Air Force Fact sheet on the craft says the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk served in numerous combat areas during the war, including the Southwest Pacific, the Aleutian Islands, the Far East, the Middle East, Italy and some went to Russia. Though other aircraft often outperformed them in speed, maneuverability and rate of climb, the P-40 earned a reputation in battle for extreme ruggedness. According to historians, before the U.S. entered WW II, many U.S. volunteer pilots flew for China, Canada, Britian and the Soviet Union. A group of them \u2014 reads the web site www.flyingtigersavg.com \u2014 helped China as the country struggled against Japan and the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese army became known as the Flying Tigers and flew under the command of Gen. Clair Channault. Their P-40s were painted with the Chinese stars on the tops and bottoms of each wing, to identify the plane as a war ally and not an enemy plane. When the Warhawk left the CBS hanger, it was a replication of the Texan Flying Tiger Tex Hill\u2019s plane. His name and war battle scorecard are painted on the left side of the plane. The Flying Tiger logo and the \u201cFlying Panda\u2019s (one group of the Flying Tigers) are also painted on the plane as well as the Chinese stars . \u201cI had a long, wonderful history with Tex Hill,\u201d said Kinney. \u201cHe was as sharp a man as you could ever meet, even well into his 90\u2019s.\u201d Kinney said that he has a real connection with these WW II pilots. \u201cThe men who flew them were the age of my father,\u201d said Kinney. \u201cI met a lot of them personally.\u201d Aircraft and Engine Mechanic Larry Lange was the primary mechanic and had the responsibility of overseeing the whole restoration of the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk at the CBS Hangar. Machinists Norb Mages of Lindsay and Dennis Lopez of Thackerville, Okla. came to see the plane off. Both worked on the airplane and oversaw projects that involved retrofitting and overhauling. \u201cThis has been a great experience,\u201d said Mages. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this off and on for two years. \u201d\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to be a part of it,\u201d said Lopez. \u201cThere are a lot of things that go through the machine shop but this takes the cake.\u201d Lange said that Mark Zello, owner of \u201cFlying Colors,\u201d was responsible for painting the plane, including the famous shark teeth. Retired pilot Mike Cavanagh came by to see the Warhawk off. \u201cI think every pilot is proud of Ray Kinney, the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk, and the work that Larry did,\u201d said Cavanagh. \u201cI would just come in and enviously watch it,\u201d said Cavanagh. \u201cI just watched it being put together, like a painting.\u201d To learn more about the CAF, how to become involved with WWII aircraft, or to find the groups touring schedule, go to www.commemorativeairforce.org.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Gainesville", "latitude": 33.6259, "longitude": -97.1333}, {"name": "Gainesville", "latitude": 33.6259, "longitude": -97.1333}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Vietnam", "latitude": 16.1667, "longitude": 107.833}, {"name": "Aleutian Islands", "latitude": 52.0969, "longitude": -173.501}, {"name": "Far East", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Middle East", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Italy", "latitude": 42.8333, "longitude": 12.8333}, {"name": "Russia", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 105.0}, {"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -96.0}, {"name": "Britian", "latitude": 54.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "Soviet Union", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 105.0}, {"name": "Japan", "latitude": 36.0, "longitude": 138.0}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Chinese", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 105.0}, {"name": "Chinese", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 105.0}, {"name": "Texan", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Chinese", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 105.0}, {"name": "Lindsay", "latitude": 33.6359, "longitude": -97.2228}, {"name": "Thackerville", "latitude": 33.7934, "longitude": -97.1431}, {"name": "Okla.", "latitude": 35.5003, "longitude": -97.5006}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Jerry Hughes bought his dog in Caddo, Okla. and he called him Okie. Now Hughes \u2014a 72-year old Cooke County resident \u2014 is having a hard time understanding why a brazen group stopped and picked up the eight month old dog. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they just drove up to my yard and took my dog,\u201d Hughes said. This isn\u2019t the first time Hughes and his wife have lost pets. He said a few years ago he had two other dogs. One of them was a cherished pet named Heck who he found on his doorstep one Christmas Day. \u201cMe and my wife were sitting in the house and we heard this whimpering noise and I wondered what in the world it was. We went outside and there was little dog in a box. Hughes said he joked with his wife about getting rid of the tiny puppy. \u201cBut I would never do anything like that,\u201d he said. Hughes said he and his wife fed the foundling with a bottle. \u201cHe was just a baby,\u201d he said. Heck grew up and Hughes said he developed a bond with his dog. \u201cHe was special. He was really special,\u201d he said. The other dog was a sweet Jack Russell terrier. But Heck was special. Heck had a habit of stopping by while Hughes was sitting in a chair in his living room. One day the dog walked up to his owner and lingered by the chair. The dog seemed uneasy or scared. At first, Hughes said he didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong. \u201cI thought he wanted me to pet him,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I petted his chest. He always liked me to pet him like this, \u201c he said, reaching out with his arm. Heck suddenly slumped at his feet. \u201cHe died in my arms,\u201d Hughes recalled, his eyes full of sorrow. Outside, he found the couple\u2019s Jack Russell stretched out on the ground, also dead. \u201cHe was stiff, you know. He\u2019d been there a while,\u201d Hughes said. He believes both dogs were poisoned. The latest incident finds Hughes grieving all over again. He said the crime was hard to comprehend. Two cars drove past his house and Okie - who was a friendly dog \u2014 just jumped into one of the cars. \u201cAll they had to do was whistle and he got right in the car,\u201d he said.

His first concern was that the thieves might hurt Okie. \u201cThen I realized they weren\u2019t going to do anything to him. They took him because they wanted him,\u201d he said. Hughes also said he knows there isn\u2019t much anyone can do. \u201cI called the Lindsay Police and I talked to a (Cooke County) deputy that came out, but I don\u2019t think they can do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had to tell somebody.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Lindsay", "latitude": 33.6359, "longitude": -97.2228}, {"name": "Caddo", "latitude": 34.1268, "longitude": -96.2633}, {"name": "Okla.", "latitude": 35.5003, "longitude": -97.5006}, {"name": "Cooke County", "latitude": 33.6334, "longitude": -97.217}, {"name": "Lindsay", "latitude": 33.6359, "longitude": -97.2228}, {"name": "Cooke County", "latitude": 33.6334, "longitude": -97.217}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Area girls from Cooke, Grayson and Love counties will get the chance to be the first ever queen and princess for Rodeo Gainesville. The Gainesville Riding Club will host Rodeo Gainesville during May 7-9 at the Gainesville Riding Club Arena. Known as rodeo royalty, the queen and princess candidates will be judged on two separate divisions: tickets sales and a riding pattern. Sixty percent of the girls overall score will be based upon their ticket sales, said Whitney Lemons, rodeo queen/princess coordinator. The other 40 percent, will be scored from a riding pattern the girls will be given before the rodeo. \u201cThe riding pattern has not yet been released,\u201d said Lemons. \u201cWe won\u2019t release that until two weeks before hand, maybe even a week until the rodeo in order to give them a little bit of time to get familiar with it and to practice. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to give the girls enough time to practice it everyday because we want to know how they work under pressure and on the spot.\u201d Queen candidates must be between the ages of 14-18 and princess candidates must be between the ages of 10-13, added Lemons. All candidates must have their own horse, have never been married or have any children and must have permission to compete from a legal guardian. Prizes for the crowned queen and princess will include a trophy saddle and other prizes to be donated by local merchants such as a belt buckle and sash. The girls will have six weeks to sell tickets, said Lemons. Ticket sales will begin Monday, March 28. However the deadline to apply for queen or princess has been extended through Friday, April 3. Interested girls can receive an application for queen or princess at Landmark Bank in Gainesville, 1110 E California Street; American Bank in Whitesboro, 851 Highway 377 N; or by contacting Lemons at (940) 736-8059. As part of the application process, Lemons said the girls will have to complete a short questionnaire to give the judges an idea of each candidate\u2019s personality. The winning queen and princess will get to ride nightly in the Rodeo Gainesville as part of the grand entry, said Lemons. Not only will they be featured nightly, but a special crowning will take place during Friday night\u2019s performance. The girls will also get the chance to ride and participate throughout the year as Rodeo Gainesville\u2019s queen and princess at other rodeos and parades of their choice. While the competition should be taken seriously, said Lemons, the main goal for the queen and princess competition is to give area cowgirls a moment to shine and to have fun. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty easy going,\u201d said Lemons. \u201cWe want to make it something that anybody can participate in. You don\u2019t have to be in the horse industry as far as showing or having real high-end horses. We just want it to be something that someone who has a horse for every day riding can compete in and to give all the young cowgirls in the counties a chance to compete.\u201d Lemons, who was the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce Rodeo Queen in 2001, described her experience as rodeo royalty as a great honor. \u201cIt is a great thing to be involved in and a great honor to hold,\u201d said Lemons. \u201cThe best advice I can give to girls competing, I would have to say, is to just work your ticket sales and know your riding pattern.

A state House leader is sponsoring a bill this session that would make it easier for his industry to sell houses. State Rep. Jay Roberts (R-Ocilla), chairman of the House Majority Caucus, is pushing HB 516, which would prohibit Georgia communities from putting restrictions on modular homes, which are built off-site at a factory. Roberts is a manager at Georgia Modular Systems, of Fitzgerald, a maker of manufactured homes, duplexes and townhouses. The lawmaker said he doesn\u2019t consider working on the issue a conflict of interest. \u201cI don\u2019t own a plant, but I do work in a plant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but nobody understands this issue. Nobody understands this business.\u201d He said his company does not sell many houses in Georgia. On his financial disclosure form, Roberts lists himself as an employee of Georgia Modular Systems. In an interview Friday, Roberts would not specify his position at the company, only saying he worked \u201cin management.\u201d He previously was a vice president at another modular-home business. Only a few Georgia cities, including Gainesville and Duluth, have zoning rules that restrict modular homes, but the issue has come up across the United States. Roberts\u2019 legislation stems from a legal battle that arose in 2005, when Gainesville officials stopped a local modular-home builder from finishing several homes in the city. Grant Smerecznsky, owner of Building Systems Network LLC, sued, and the issue is pending in the courts. He approached Roberts and Steve Snyder, executive director of the Modular Building Systems Association in Harrisburg, Pa. Smerecznsky said he has never used Roberts\u2019 company as a supplier, but he would if he had the chance. He said he does not think Roberts is serving his own interests with the bill. He said Roberts is simply standing up for an industry that he believes is being discriminated against by some communities because they think modular means mobile homes. \u201cHe\u2019s doing what an elected official should do,\u201d Smerecznsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing something for the people.\u201d Gainesville Mayor Myrtle Figueras would not comment, citing the court case. Councilman Danny Dunagan also said he could not comment on the case, but said of the bill, \u201cI have a real problem with a legislator pushing legislation that directly affects his business. I think that\u2019s kind of unethical.\u201d Rick Thompson, executive secretary of the Georgia State Ethics Commission, said nothing in the state Ethics-in-Government act prohibits a lawmaker from submitting legislation related to his own business. Snyder said he called Roberts to talk to him about the issue. Asked in an interview who lobbied for the issue, Snyder said, \u201cI did.\u201d Thompson said lobbyists for an industry \u201care required to register and report if they undertake to promote or oppose legislation.\u201d Told about this later, Synder said he initially misspoke. He said he talked with Roberts and provided him copies of similar legislation in other states, but he did not come to Georgia and lobby. Snyder is not registered to lobby in Georgia. Snyder said he was thinking of flying down for debate on the bill last week, but he decided not to because, \u201cI thought this whole thing was taken care of.\u201d Asked about Roberts pushing a bill affecting his business, Snyder said, \u201cI get that, but there is nothing diabolical here. I need a legislator who understands our industry. He said he\u2019d be happy to do it.\u201d Synder said Roberts \u201creally did a great job for us. I would hate to see this guy get mud on him.\u201d Roberts\u2019 bill has passed out of the House and is now under consideration in the Senate. Just before it passed, however, opponents of the bill submitted an amendment that weakens its authority over local zoning. The change, Snyder said, \u201cmakes the bill worthless to us.\u201d Roberts said he is now trying to change it back in the Senate. Al Outland, spokesman for the Georgia Municipal Association, said the group was concerned the bill would overrule local zoning, but the amendment allayed their concerns.

A new detention facility planned for the heart of its Midtown district has some Gainesville officials wringing their hands. The city, in talks with Hall County and Corrections Corporation of America, wants to insure that the new prison, which will house up to 502 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, meets its idea of urban revitalization. The city began a project 10 years ago to clean up the rundown area and invested $250,000 in a study to map out a revitalization strategy, said City Councilman Danny Dunagan. Nashville-based CCA signed a five-year agreement to lease the old county jail from Hall County to operate the center on Main Street. The 20-year lease, with two 5-year renewals, will pay Hall County $2 million annually. \u201cThe last thing we want in downtown for 20 years is a prison,\u201d Dunagan said. The city has invested a lot in its Midtown revitalization, including a new police/fire station. Plans also call for a 13-story hotel and two nine-story office buildings. The city had even worked out a verbal agreement with the county to buy the old jail, Dunagan said. The plan called for the city to then lease the facility back to the county so it could sub-lease it to CCA, he said. But that deal would have run for eight years, Dunagan said, then the city would have the option of shutting it down. Councilman George Wangemann said the city is behind the economic boost the prison could bring to the city, but he wants it to fit in with the aesthetics. Louise Grant, CCA marketing and communications director, said that while the company is in the business of operating prisons, it is working to resolve the aesthetics issue with the city. \u201cSafety and security is our first and foremost priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re making a $4 million investment to upgrade the facility.\u201d Grant said razor wire is common at all its 60 facilities, but alternative fencing is being discussed.

Regional 2-1-1, a dialing code linking needy Georgia residents with everything from food pantries to social services, could begin expanding statewide by the end of the year, United Way officials said. If approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, the expansion would stretch the service to 69 currently unserved counties. Those include several rural counties, among the hardest-hit by foreclosure and unemployment in the state. \u201cYou want folks to be able to have access to information that helps them address basic needs \u2014 and you want them to be able to access that information wherever they live in the state,\u201d said Milton J. Little Jr., president of United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, which initiated the exchange in 1997 and is leading efforts to expand statewide. United Way officials hope to submit a proposal to the commission by the end of the year. Right now, 2-1-1 callers are connected with operators at one of 11 call centers serving metropolitan regions across the state. Callers explain their needs to operators \u2014 anything from shelter after a weather catastrophe to rental assistance \u2014 who refer them to area service agencies. Organizers say the idea is to help people navigate the complex and ever-growing network of programs. It helps the needy in the most heavily populated areas of Georgia. But United Way officials have lacked the funds to expand to farther-flung areas, Little said. For them, \u201cresources as critical as emergency financial help to as general as where do I find a place to send my aging parents \u2014 they just don\u2019t have access,\u201d Little said. Expansion plans coincide with an increase in calls to the line. Operators fielded more than 370,000 calls in 2008, up from more than 336,000 in 2007. Little said some calls this time last year were for post-tornado help in the region. \u201cA lot of those callers now are bringing up issues related to food, clothing and shelter,\u201d said Little, who recently estimated 41.5 percent of Atlanta-area calls are for help with day-to-day expenses. Other states have been pushing to expand the program which United Way estimates connects 234 million people with social services. There are 29 states with full coverage, according to Linda Daily, director for 2-1-1 at United Way of America. They include Texas, where state funds cover 80 percent of the program\u2019s budget, she said. But many states are grappling with heavy shortfalls, and Daily acknowledged funding 2-1-1 could be a challenge. \u201cThe budget is the main hurdle,\u201d she said, adding national United Way officials have lobbied Congress for help nationalizing the 2-1-1 program.

Ten persons, most of them affiliated with former parliamentary speaker Nino Burjanadze\u2019s party, have been arrested on charges of illegal purchase of firearms, the Georgian Interior Ministry said on March 23. Earlier on the same day Democratic Movement\u2013United Georgia (DMUG) party said nine of its activists were arrested in Batumi and Tbilisi, accusing the authorities of launching \u201ccampaign of terror\u201d against its activists. The Interior Ministry said it was not claiming \u201ca political conspiracy\u201d behind the arms purchase. \u201cThe Interior Ministry, along with other preventive measures, is constantly monitoring illegal turnover of arms,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement. \u201cRecently several groups have been identified, which were showing interest in purchasing automatic firearms. Several members of these groups were arrested this morning. The Interior Ministry was not planning to make any statement until the end of the investigation, but some political and public organizations have responded to the incident and the issue was seriously politicized. The representatives of some political parties made tough statements. Hence, the Interior Ministry is providing to the society a part of evidence proving criminal activities of the detainees. Other evidences and information will be unveiled later.\u201d The evidence involves six separate episodes of covertly recorded footage of what seems to be a sting operation by undercover agents acting as arms dealers. In the fist footage a man identified as Giorgi Bolashvili, an activist from DMUG youth wing, negotiates with undercover agent terms for purchase of CZ-75 semi-automatic pistol for USD 400 and expresses desire to buy AKS-U submachine gun \u2013 a shortened version of Kalashnikov assault rifle. In the second footage a man identified as Bolashvili\u2019s cousin with the same first and second name \u2013 Giorgi Bolashvili meets the same undercover agent to buy the firearm. In the third episode a man identified as Vakhtang Narsia, an activist from DMUG youth wing, holding apparently UZI submachine gun, is discussing with another man \u2013 supposedly also an undercover agent \u2013 mobilization of supporters. In the fourth footage, Mamuka Shengelia, a driver of Badri Bitsadze, husband of Nino Burjanadze, is seen discussing specifications and price of various firearms with a person \u2013 apparently also an undercover agent. In the fifth and sixth footage a person identified as Giorgi Tsertsvadze is seen \u2013 his name was not listed among the DMUG\u2019s arrested activists released earlier by the party itself. Tsertsvadze, according to the Interior Ministry, was acting under the instructions of Shengelia to purchase the firearms. The sixth footage, also recorded covertly in what seems to be an apartment room, Tsertsvadze is checking various types of firearms massed in a corner of the room. Shota Utiashvili, head of the Interior Ministry\u2019s analytical department, has strongly denied any politics behind the arrest of these persons and also said that the investigation was not claiming there was \u201ca political conspiracy.\u201d \u201cWhat we know is that there are people who have showed interest in buying weapons and have bought weapons and they are arrested,\u201d Utiashvili said. Nino Burjanadze, the leader of DMUG, said after the Interior Ministry\u2019s statement that she was ready to cooperate with the investigation. She, however, said the evidence put forth by the investigation was not enough and needed further scrutiny. \u201cNot a single normal court will consider the evidences shown on TV as enough evidence to prove the charges that have been made,\u201d she told journalists. \u201cWe are familiar with such \u2018video evidence\u2019 and how they are made up. The footage needs very serious expertise. Probably the Interior Ministry will make this expertise. We will also try to make this expertise through our independent sources: when the footage was recorded, in what context, when and how the footage was edited and so on.\u201d \u201cWe are not rejecting to cooperate with the investigation,\u201d Burjanadze said and also added that the footage provided by the Interior Ministry would fail to confirm the allegations that her party was planning \u201carmed rebellion and was setting up armed groups for this purpose.\u201d Earlier this month the Georgian tabloid Alia reported that Bitsadze had a plan to set up armed groups. In an unusual move, the Rustavi 2 TV, picked up the newspaper article and covered the allegations extensively in its primetime news program on March 10. Meanwhile, it also emerged on March 23, that an activist from the Movement for Salvation of Georgia was arrested and charged with plotting a coup. The Movement for Salvation of Georgia was set up late last year and has not been an active player in the Georgian politics. Shota Utiashvili of the Interior Ministry told Civil. Ge that this arrest was not related with the case of illegal arms purchase. He said the Interior Ministry would unveil more details on the matter later.

Irakli Okruashvili, former defense minister, said Georgia was in a situation wherein removal of President Saakashvili from power \u201cis justified with any humanely method,\u201d as he posed \u201cgreater threat\u201d to the country than Russia. Okruashvili, whose party Movement for United Georgia is part of group of another dozen of opposition parties planning to launch street protest rallies from April 9 to demand the President\u2019s resignation, said in a televised interview that he personally had no presidential ambitions. The interview, which was recorded in Paris on March 24, was aired by late on March 27 by the Tbilisi-based Maestro TV, which covers mainly the capital city. Okruashvili, who has received political asylum in France, was sentenced to 11-year prison term in Georgia in absentia last year. \u201cAfter [the August] war politicians should give up manipulating with the issue of restoration of the territorial integrity, especially during the election campaign, because that is an issue, which will be impossible to resolve in next ten or fifteen years in the best case, if not in the next twenty or twenty five years,\u201d he said. Okruashvili said that after the August \u201cmilitary adventure\u201d Saakashvili had \u201cno legitimate right to stay in power.\u201d \u201cI know that the remarks, which I will say now will trigger lots of sharp comments, but I have to say it anyway \u2013 this is the case when removal of Saakashvili from power is justifiable with any humanely method. He is today the number one threat for the country and the greater threat than Russia,\u201d Okruashvili said. He said he did not believe that Russia was interested in removal of Georgia\u2019s current leadership and said such rhetoric was part of the authorities\u2019 \u201cpropaganda.\u201d \u201cA weak figure [in the Georgian leadership] like Saakashvili is more acceptable for Russia,\u201d Okruashvili said. \u201cSaakashvili, who has almost no western support and no one in the west is even saying hello to him, is more acceptable for Russia. New leader in Georgia means new hope\u2026 One thing is clear: Saakashvili is a headache for both the Georgian people and for the international community.\u201d \u201cIf in 2003 [the Rose Revolution] was called the democratic revolution, than today too the same right exists to repeat it; is there enough resources or not for that purpose, that\u2019s another issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is up to the Georgian people, it is our duty to maximally painlessly remove Saakashvili from power. How that will be achieved? No one has the answer on that today\u2026 A right vision, a joint action plan on where we are moving is required here, instead of changing plans every day. If there is a clear vision and joint plan [by the opposition] it will be achieved.\u201d \u201cRemoval of Saakashvili will be a painful process and it won\u2019t be able to achieve in a day; it won\u2019t happen on April 9,\u201d he said. Okruashvili said that unity of the opposition was the only \u201cmedicine that will help to removal Saakashvili.\u201d \u201cWe [the opposition leaders] should forget all the personal regrets and mutual confrontation that we might had in the past,\u201d he said and added his party\u2019s relation with the one of former parliamentary chairperson Nino Burjanadze\u2019s was a good example of that. He said that in 2007 when he was arrested, Burjanadze, who was the parliamentary chairperson at that time welcomed his arrested and \u201cmade a speech in the Parliament which amounted to accusing me in the state treason; but today I have no problem in relations with Burjanadze, because we will fail to achieve our joint goal without forgetting personal regrets of the past.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Russia", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 42.0, "longitude": 43.5}, {"name": "Russia", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 42.0, "longitude": 43.5}, {"name": "Paris", "latitude": 48.8534, "longitude": 2.3488}, {"name": "Tbilisi", "latitude": 41.725, "longitude": 44.7908}, {"name": "France", "latitude": 46.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 42.0, "longitude": 43.5}, {"name": "Russia", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Russia", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 42.0, "longitude": 43.5}, {"name": "Georgian", "latitude": 42.0, "longitude": 43.5}, {"name": "Russia", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Russia", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 42.0, "longitude": 43.5}, {"name": "Georgian", "latitude": 42.0, "longitude": 43.5}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Diplomats are pushing urgent peace talks between Georgian and South Ossetian officials to avert all-out war as heavy fighting in the region killed at least a dozen yesterday. Tensions have only escalated in breakaway South Ossetia after severe violence last weekend, and show no sign of abating. The streets of the secessionist capital are reportedly abandoned and Tbilisi says the South Ossetian separatist leader has fled. In an address to the nation yesterday evening, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. \u201cA few hours ago I gave an order\u0097a very painful order for a commander-in-chief to give\u0097that not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.\u201d \u201cWe must stop this spiral of violence.\u201d Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for tomorrow. Talks scheduled for yesterday were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and Georgian officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked last weekend after the fiercest fighting in years left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over the last several days. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. Tbilisi says the separatists launched an attack yesterday on the Georgian-controlled villages of Nuli and Avnevi in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening Utiashvili said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of Prisi reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above Prisi. Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone\u2019s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists\u2019 attacks are made \u201cwith the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.\u201d An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a \u201crotation of military forces near Gori.\u201d A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours. Yesterday\u2019s Georgian Foreign Ministry statement said Moscow shoulders much of the blame for the violence. \u201cThe only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military, human and technical resources provided to them by the Russian Federation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the Russian Federation will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the Tskhinvali region.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister said the remarks were \u201cunfair\u201d and that Moscow is trying to mediate in the crisis to prevent more bloodshed. The Georgian president\u2019s speech, delivered after the Foreign Ministry statement was released, changed the tone on Russia\u2019s responsibility for the clashes: \u201cThe leaders of the [Russian] peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists\u2019 actions\u0085 We are in constant contact with the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s leadership. The Russian Foreign Ministry is trying\u0097they say they are trying, but not succeeding\u0097to get the separatists to cease fire.\u201d Georgia is Russia\u2019s \u201cnatural ally,\u201d said Saakashvili. Tbilisi urges talks after negotiations fail Georgia\u2019s top official for conflict issues, Temur Iakobashvili, told reporters that hoped-for talks fell through after he traveled to the conflict zone yesterday, where South Ossetian representatives refused to meet him. \u201cTskhinvali looked empty, as I know [separatist leader Eduard] Kokoity has left the town,\u201d Iakobashvili said, adding that Russia\u2019s own envoy was not able to reach Tskhinvali due to car troubles. Asked whether Georgian army troops could be sent into South Ossetia, Iakobashvili said: \u201cWe are doing everything to resolve the tense situation by peaceful means. However, we\u2019re always ready to protect our citizens wherever they are.\u201d Earlier in the week Tbilisi announced that direct talks were scheduled, but South Ossetian officials later said they would not participate, insisting that any negotiations must be within the Joint Control Commission format which includes Russian, North Ossetian, South Ossetian and Georgian representatives. Georgia says the Joint Control Commission is unbalanced and declared last year it would no longer take part in its meetings. Saakashvili last night called for direct talks in \u201cany kind of format.\u201d He also reiterated offers of wide autonomy for South Ossetia within Georgia, which he said Russia could oversee. Deep international concern The OSCE, EU and UN all weighed in yesterday with statements of concern over the violence, calling for an immediate halt and direct negotiations. Reuters reported that senior US State Department official Daniel Fried and the deputy Russian foreign minister had spoken and agreed to cooperate on keeping the violence from growing.", "response":

The trio broke off from the group to explore the mountain of Ushba and have not been heard from since August 4. The remaining members reported the missing climbers to a Border Police checkpoint, which immediately sent out a small search group. They began searching August 5; the next day, another twenty border guards joined the search.

WASHINGTON \u2014 Denouncing a \u201csquandering of the people\u2019s money,\u201d lawmakers voted decisively Thursday to impose a 90 percent tax on millions of dollars in employee bonuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies. The House vote was 328-93. Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate and President Barack Obama quickly signaled general support for the concept. \u201cI look forward to receiving a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated,\u201d the president said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told colleagues, \u201cWe want our money back now for the taxpayers. It isn\u2019t that complicated.\u201d The outcome may not have been complicated. But the lopsided vote failed to reflect the contentious political battle that preceded it. Republicans took Democrats to task for rushing to tax AIG bonuses worth an estimated $165 million after the majority party stripped from last month\u2019s economic stimulus bill a provision that could have banned such payouts. \u201cThis political circus that\u2019s going on here today with this bill is not getting to the bottom of the questions of who knew what and when did they know it,\u201d said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio. He voted \u201cno,\u201d but 85 fellow Republicans joined 243 Democrats in voting \u201cyes.\u201d It was opposed by six Democrats and 87 Republicans. The bill would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses given to employees with family incomes above $250,000 at American International Group and other companies that have received at least $5 billion in government bailout money. It would apply to any such bonuses issued since Dec. 31. The House vote, after just 40 minutes of debate, showed how quickly Congress can act when the political will is there. It was only this past weekend that the bailed-out insurance giant paid bonuses totaling $165 million to employees, including traders in the Financial Products unit that nearly brought about AIG\u2019s collapse. AIG has received $182.5 billion in federal bailout money and is now 80 percent government owned. Disclosure of the bonuses touched off a national firestorm that both the Obama administration and Congress have scurried to contain. In a statement issued by the White House late Thursday, Obama said the House vote \u201crightly reflects the outrage that so many feel over the lavish bonuses that AIG provided its employees at the expense of the taxpayers who have kept this failed company afloat. \u201d\u201cIn the end, this is a symptom of a larger problem \u2014 a bubble-and-bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what we must ultimately repair to build a lasting and widespread prosperity.\u201d Topic No. 1 raised by Republicans during the House debate was the last-minute altering of a provision in Obama\u2019s $787 billion stimulus law to cap executive compensation for firms receiving government bailouts. The measure might have forestalled payment of the AIG bonuses. But Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat and the author of the provision, says the administration insisted that he modify his proposal so that it would only apply to payments agreed to in the future. That, critics claim, cleared the way for the AIG payouts. \u201cThe idea came from the administration,\u201d Dodd said ThursdayDodd said he was not aware of any AIG bonuses at the time the change was made. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner confirmed such conversations with Dodd. He said the administration was worried about possible legal challenges to the provision. \u201cWe expressed concern about this specific version,\u201d Geithner said in an interview with CNN. \u201cBut we also worked with him to strengthen the overall bill.\u201d The treasury secretary, who has been criticized for not learning of the AIG bonus payments sooner since he helped orchestrate the bailout last year as president of the New York Fed, said anew in the interview that he was not informed of the bonuses until last week. \u201cAnd as soon as I heard about the full scale of these things, we moved very actively to explore every possible legal avenue to address this problem,\u201d Geithner said. A similar \u2014 but not as punitive \u2014 bill to recoup bonus payments with taxes was gaining support in the Senate. It would impose a 35 percent excise tax on the companies paying the bonuses and a 35 percent tax on the employees receiving them. The taxes would apply to all companies receiving government bailout money, but they are clearly geared toward AIG. \u201cThis is not just another case of runaway corporate greed and arrogance, ripping off shareholders by excesses lavished around the executive suite,\u201d said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D. \u201cThese bonuses represent a squandering of the people\u2019s money. ... Starting right here, right now, we are saying no more.\u201d The Senate measure is sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and the panel\u2019s senior Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa. It was expected to be brought to the Senate floor next week. Meanwhile, New York\u2019s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, said AIG has given him the list of employees who received a total of $165 million in retention bonuses. Cuomo said he won\u2019t release any employees\u2019 names until his office has answered any security concerns raised by the AIG employees. He also said he will work with AIG in the coming days to determine which workers have decided to return the payments. Cuomo had sought the names from AIG chief executive Edward Liddy through a subpoena. The deadline was Thursday. About 400 AIG employees and future employees received bonuses, but not all of them earned over the $250,000 family income threshold specified by the House bill. Obama administration special envoy Richard Holbooke was on AIG\u2019s board of directors in early 2008, when the insurance company committed to the bonuses, and during the previous years of aggressive investment strategies that brought the firm to brink of collapse. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Thursday: \u201cMr. Holbrooke had nothing to do with and knew nothing about the bonuses.\u201d While the House legislation calls for a 90 percent tax, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said he expected local and state governments to take the remaining 10 percent of the bonuses. Rangel said the bill would apply to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among others, while excluding community banks and other smaller companies that have received less bailout money. \u201cThe American people demand protection and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing today,\u201d he told the House.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "WASHINGTON", "latitude": 38.8951, "longitude": -77.0364}, {"name": "Calif", "latitude": 37.2502, "longitude": -119.751}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "New York", "latitude": 43.0003, "longitude": -75.4999}, {"name": "N.D.", "latitude": 47.5003, "longitude": -100.001}, {"name": "Montana", "latitude": 47.0002, "longitude": -109.751}, {"name": "Iowa", "latitude": 42.0003, "longitude": -93.5005}, {"name": "New York", "latitude": 43.0003, "longitude": -75.4999}, {"name": "N.Y.", "latitude": 43.0003, "longitude": -75.4999}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The whole experience was a lot of fun, and I would definitely do it again if I could.\u201d While Dyer was showing her contest heifer in Houston on the day of the 2009 queen participants\u2019 contest presentations, she said she was very impressed with the video recording of the contest. \u201cI think everybody did a really great job with their projects, and I think every one of the contestants has a really good shot at earning the crown,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t win, I hope they continue on and participate in the contest next year. \u201cRegardless of who wins the contest, I would just want to tell that person not to take the experience for granted.

WASHINGTON \u2014 The military is racing to inspect more than 90,000 U.S.-run facilities across Iraq to reduce a deadly threat troops face far off the battlefield: electrocution or shock while showering or using appliances. About one-third of the inspections so far have turned up major electrical problems, according to interviews and an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Half of the problems they found have since been fixed but about 65,000 facilities still need to be inspected, which could take the rest of this year. Senior Pentagon officials were on Capitol Hill this week for briefings on the findings. The work assigned to Task Force SAFE, which oversees the inspections and repairs, is aimed at preventing deaths like that of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, 24, of Pittsburgh. He died in January 2008, one of at least three soldiers killed while showering since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Scores more soldiers suffered shocks between September 2006 and July 2008, according to a database maintained by KBR Inc., the Houston-based contractor that oversees maintenance at most U.S. facilities in Iraq. \u201cWe got a ton of buildings we know probably aren\u2019t safe and we just don\u2019t have them done yet,\u201d said Jim Childs, an electrician the task force hired to help with the inspections. \u201cIt\u2019s Russian roulette. I cringe every time I hear of a shock.\u201d Ron Vance, who served as a sergeant in the California Army National Guard, remembers being knocked out cold in a shower building in 2004 in Taji, Iraq. He said he screamed and fell while showering, suffering burns on his back and shoulders. Another soldier who tried to pry him from the shower head also was injured. Vance, 57, of Fresno, Calif., said he\u2019s still too traumatized to shower without his wife nearby. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. , called Task Force SAFE\u2019s findings troubling. He said the task force is doing good work but said problems should have been fixed much earlier. \u201cJust imagine getting the news that they\u2019ve done 25,000 facilities, but your son or daughter is in the 65,000 they haven\u2019t done,\u201d Casey told the AP. Last year, 94 troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan or other Central Command countries sought medical treatment for electric shock, according to Defense Department health data. KBR\u2019s database lists 231 electric shock incidents in the more than 89,000 facilities the company runs in Iraq, according to military records. KBR is the target of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Maseth\u2019s family. They claim the company knew there were electrical problems in the building where he died, but didn\u2019t fix them. His mother testified last year on Capitol Hill. Army investigators have since reclassified Maseth\u2019s death as negligent homicide caused by KBR and two of its supervisors. An Army investigator said KBR failed to ensure work was done by qualified electricians and plumbers. The case is under legal review. \u201cKBR is not responsible for the electrocution deaths widely reported, including that of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth,\u201d Heather Browne, a KBR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. KBR and another contractor, Arkel International, are the targets of a second lawsuit, filed by the family of another soldier electrocuted in Iraq, Staff Sgt. Christopher Lee Everett, 23, of Huntsville, Texas. Everett, a member of the Texas Army National Guard, was killed in September 2005 when the power washer he was using to clean a vehicle short-circuited. Task Force SAFE inspectors found many of the facilities that fall under KBR\u2019s contract have electrical problems, according to an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Of the 20,340 maintained by KBR and inspected so far, 6,935 failed the government inspection, the document said. When about 2,000 of the buildings with faulty work were re-inspected, the facilities passed, the document said. The Defense Contract Management Agency has accepted KBR\u2019s plans to correct the problems, according to the document the AP obtained. It said the agency will closely oversee KBR\u2019s work. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., questioned why KBR has been allowed to continue to perform electrical work in Iraq. He said the military should take a more careful look at the electrical work in Afghanistan, too, where KBR also has a large contract for electrical work. \u201cIf they found widespread problems, the obvious question is why has there not been action to remove the contract and bring in another contractor?\u201d Dorgan said. Browne, the company spokeswoman, said KBR has cooperated with the government, performing technical inspection and providing requested information. Task Force SAFE (the acronym stands for Safety Action for Fire and Electricity) said it is making progress. The Army is tracking reports of just over two fires each day in Iraq, mostly blamed on electrical faults. But that\u2019s down from nearly five fires a day, Brig. Gen. Kurt Stein said in an e-mail to the AP. Stein said the number of electrical shocks has also been reduced. \u201cAlthough we are still seeing some electrical shocks, they tend to be minor and are often preventable,\u201d Stein said. In addition to the repairs, Stein said the military has purchased more reliable surge protectors to replace ones that had been bought in Iraq. \u201cOur hearts go out to the families of those who died or were injured from electrical shock or fire,\u201d Stein said. \u201cWe take our job to inspect, identify, repair and prevent electrical and fire incidents very seriously.\u201d Vance, the guardsman who was shocked in the shower, said the military didn\u2019t take his injuries seriously. He\u2019s since retired on partial disability from the Veterans Affairs Department for a \u201ccognitive disorder\u201d related to the incident, but he has sought additional compensation for what he describes as ongoing knee and shoulder problems for falling in the shower. \u201cI really don\u2019t think they cared. I didn\u2019t die,\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a priority on their list. It was like, he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s alive. He\u2019s OK.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "WASHINGTON", "latitude": 38.8951, "longitude": -77.0364}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Capitol Hill", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Pittsburgh", "latitude": 40.4406, "longitude": -79.9959}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Houston", "latitude": 29.7633, "longitude": -95.3633}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Russian", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "California", "latitude": 37.2502, "longitude": -119.751}, {"name": "Taji", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Fresno", "latitude": 36.7477, "longitude": -119.772}, {"name": "Calif.", "latitude": 37.2502, "longitude": -119.751}, {"name": "Pa.", "latitude": 40.2725, "longitude": -76.9057}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Afghanistan", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 65.0}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Capitol Hill", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "N.D.", "latitude": 47.5003, "longitude": -100.001}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Afghanistan", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 65.0}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}, {"name": "Iraq", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": 44.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

However, the students will have to pay an additional $40 per test if they register after Tuesday.\u201d Surley said the exam schedule is the same for every high school in the country, and the days students take their specific tests depend on that schedule. \u201cStudents cannot change the days they take tests on, but most of the time, they don\u2019t overlap on tests,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just really want to encourage students to take these tests, because they\u2019re basically earning college credit at a largely reduced rate. \u201cStudents should also know they are eligible to take any AP exam they choose, even if they are not enrolled in the subject of the exam this semester.\u201d AP exams are scored on a five-point scale with a score of five being the highest.

Huntsville City Manager Bill Baine is currently working to gather support \u2014 both at the city level and at the county level \u2014 for an improvement project on state Highway 19. At a recent Walker County Commissioners Court meeting, the five-member court agreed to assist Baine in receiving a $2 million engineering grant with a $400,000 matching requirement. Now, Baine must take the grant before City Council, and he said he is very hopeful that the council will also be supportive of the project. \u201cThe grant we\u2019re looking at is a $2 million federal grant for economic development and hurricane mitigation,\u201d Baine said. \u201cOur justification for applying for the grant is that we want to improve Highway 19 so it can take some traffic off of Interstate 45 and around the city, especially during hurricane evacuations. \u201cReceiving this $2 million, which would be used to design of an improved 6.2-mile portion of Highway 19, would get us in line for future funding for the construction costs.\u201d According to Glenn Isbell, city engineer for the City of Huntsville, the portion of Highway 19 that would be addressed in the plan rests with Huntsville city limits and includes several major intersections. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re looking at creating an urban arterial on a portion of Highway 19 between Interstate 45 and Highway 30 that is largely undeveloped,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would involve creating a five-lane, curb and gutter section with a raised center median which would allow for left-turn movements. \u201cWe would also want to construct on- and off-ramps at the intersections of Highway 19 and state Highway 75, Bearkat Boulevard and Highway 190. With the right ramp configuration, the ramp at Bearkat Boulevard would become a major entrance into Sam Houston State University. \u201cAs well, we would also look at some possible traffic signals to control cross-over traffic, and we would also consider reducing the speed limit from 60 miles per hour to 50 in that portion of Highway 19.\u201d Including the $2 million engineering grant, Isbell said the total cost of the improvement project would be approximately $21 million. \u201cIn effect, this $2 million grant would be a down payment on the rest of the project,\u201d Baine said. \u201cThe construction project would be about $19 million total, and what we\u2019re trying to do is keep the taxpayers from paying too much, both now or during the possible construction phase. \u201cThe Commissioners Court has already agreed to pay one-third of our $400,000 matching requirement for the $2 million grant, and I anticipate that the City Council will respond favorably to assisting with that matching requirement, as well.\u201d Local considerationsThe lack of safety for current Highway 19 users is another large factor contributing to the project, Baine said. \u201cOne person a year is killed, each and ever year, on that highway,\u201d Baine said. \u201cPlus, we have about 54 crashes on that road each year which result in about 47 injuries involving some level of hospitalization. \u201cThe people getting hurt are not the old or the very young, but the middle-young, and the accidents are taking place at the times of the day when people go to school.\u201d While environmental studies, cost studies and even land acquisitions have taken place since 1968, no strong action has taken place with regard to Highway 19 until the recent county decision to provide support. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make this issue something the citizens can unite over so pressure an be put on political leaders above the city,\u201d Baine said. \u201cThe decision by the Commissioners Court to provide financial support was in many ways unprecedented, but now we have to think about working with Rep. Kevin Brady, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst and other officials to move forward.\u201d While Baine said nothing is certain with respect to earning the grant, he said he feels earning the grant and getting a set improvement plan in place are good first steps toward eventual construction. \u201cWe can\u2019t get in line for construction funding without a design ready, and that\u2019s what this money would get us,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a design ready, and with persistence in applying for funds through a variety of different avenues, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll be able to go farther with this than we have in the past.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Walker County", "latitude": 30.7335, "longitude": -95.5669}, {"name": "Interstate 45", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Highway 19", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Highway 19", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Highway 19", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Interstate 45", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Highway 30", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Highway 19", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Highway 75", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Bearkat Boulevard", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Highway 190", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Bearkat Boulevard", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Sam Houston State University", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

A Huntsville man was taken into emergency mental health custody Friday afternoon after a three-hour standoff with police in a residential neighborhood. At 12:03 p.m. Walker County dispatchers received a 911 call from a residence in the 1300 block of Avenue Q in Huntsville reporting a suicidal person. The call was made by an elderly woman who reported that her 48-year-old son had locked himself in his bedroom with a rifle and ammunition and was threatening to commit suicide. Officers from the Huntsville Police Department and the Sam Houston State University Police Department responded quickly to the scene and set up a perimeter around the residence. \u201cUPD got several officers there very quickly,\u201d said Lt. Wes Altom of the HPD\u2019s Uniformed Services Division. \u201cSome of their guys were on their way back from lunch when the call came in, and they were able to get there and help us out.\u201d Along with UPD and HPD personnel, Texas Ranger Steve Jeter also responded to the scene and donned tactical gear to assist in securing the exterior of the residence as HPD officers attempted to make contact with the suspect. While officers from both departments worked to remove the suspect\u2019s mother safely from the premises, Altom was able to make contact with the suspect by phone. \u201cI made contact with him and talked with him a little bit,\u201d Altom said. \u201cContact was sporadic at first. He would hang up, then he would call back. As that was going on we called in Lt. Kevin Lunsford and Sgt. David Collins to assist.\u201d Collins, a trained crisis negotiator, was off-duty at the time of the call, but responded to the scene to establish contact with the suspect. Lunsford, who heads the HPD\u2019s Support Services Division, established a tactical command and called in the department\u2019s Special Response Team (SRT), an eight-officer tactical force specially trained to deal with crisis situations. As the SRT prepared to enter the residence, Collins worked to establish a relationship with the suspect. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to build a rapport, but you also have to establish credibility,\u201d Collins said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to do this with sincerity. I was honest with him about what to expect and what we were going to do. He said he wanted some time to think about it.\u201d While Collins continued negotiation with the suspect, the SRT entered the residence and took position outside the suspect\u2019s room, an upstairs bedroom over a carport. \u201cBasically they were outside of a locked door that was at the bottom of the stairs,\u201d Altom said. \u201cIt\u2019s a waiting game at that point. The main goal with involving SRT is to contain the suspect so that he doesn\u2019t become a danger to others.\u201d As the standoff continued, more precautions were taken to ensure contact with the suspect could be maintained. Knowing that the suspect was speaking to Collins from a cordless phone, officers were able to bring in a backup negotiation phone by running a phone chord from the SRT\u2019s van to the home\u2019s interior.Commanding officers also took precautions against possible injury, calling in specially trained tactical medics from Huntsville\u2013Walker County EMS. \u201cTactical medics are not armed, but they\u2019re trained to be close to the action and they help with any immediate need,\u201d Altom said. After nearly three hours of negotiations, at approximately 3:15 p.m., the suspect agreed to surrender himself to police. \u201cSgt. Collins got him to come down the stairs and unlock the door, and we took him into custody,\u201d Altom said. \u201cI had the opportunity to talk with him afterwards, and he was in very good spirits considering. He was just in a very bad place today, and he knows he needs to get some help.\u201d Two rifles, a lever action and a single shot shotgun, were confiscated from the residence by police. It is unclear if the suspect was in possession of both rifles during the standoff. Police declined to identify the suspect due to the sensitivity of the incident and the fact that he was not charged with a crime. After being taken into custody, he was transported to Huntsville Memorial Hospital for a mental health evaluation. \u201cAt that point it will be decided if he\u2019s going to be released or moved to a treatment facility,\u201d Altom said. After a three-hour standoff from which everyone walked away safely, the HPD command staff was pleased with the performance of their officers. \u201cThe chief was on scene and commented on the radio at the conclusion that he thought we did a very good job,\u201d Altom said. \u201cIt takes a team effort and communication to get a positive outcome and I think we did well. \u201d\u201cThe negotiations were great, and SRT took care of the takedown when the suspect was brought out,\u201d Lunsford said. \u201cIt went very smoothly.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Walker County", "latitude": 30.7335, "longitude": -95.5669}, {"name": "Avenue Q", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Sam Houston State University", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}, {"name": "Walker County", "latitude": 30.7335, "longitude": -95.5669}, {"name": "Huntsville", "latitude": 30.7235, "longitude": -95.5508}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The Scott West Panthers sealed up the Section 2AA team championship this weekend and will make their ninth trip to state later this month. Panthers roll to Section 2AA Team Championship and their 9th trip to State. After graduating eleven seniors off of last year's team that lost a Section 2AA Team showdown of top rated teams to Jackson County Central, the Scott West Wrestling team came into the 2007-08 wrestling season with a lot of questions to be answered and on this past Saturday night in Montgomery those questions would be answered as the Panthers stormed their way to a 34-14 team victory over 7th rated Watertown-ML to win the Section 2AA Team championship. \"Personally, I am more proud of this team than any other that I have been associated with as a coach over the last 20 years,\" insists Scott West wrestling coach Darren Ripley. \"They have answered the questions and overcame so much adversity throughout the year that you can't help but feel good about them as a team.\" The Scott West Wrestling team advanced to Saturday night's Section 2AA Team championship meet with a 38-19 win over Hutchinson and a 43-21 win over Delano. However, Team Panther would save their best for last as they rallied from an early ten point team deficit to knock out the Royals from Watertown-ML. \"We have a philosophy within the program that you get stronger as the day goes on,\" comments coach Ripley. \"And our kids certainly carried it out to the mat with them on Saturday night.\" After losing the first three matches to Watertown-ML's trio of good lightweights (Drew Fleming 13-1 over Lee Goldberg, Joey Stadnick 5-0 over Tyler Zilverberg and Brandon Henrich 4-0 over Jake Siegle), it was time for the Scott Wester's to call upon 125 pounder senior Tanner Adamek. \"It's Tanner time!\" exclaims coach Ripley. Adamek went right to work scoring two take downs against Drake Matuska to take a 4-1 first period lead. However, that was just a start of things to come as Adamek scored five more take downs in the second period and then six more in the third period as the Panther wrestler worked his way to a 26-11 technical fall. \"I think Tanner's win brought a lot of energy to our side,\" states coach Ripley. \"And I think it might have cast a little doubt onto the other side.\" The \"Adamek Bomb\" ignited an eight match Panther winning streak that saw Scott West build an insurmountable 28-10 lead through 171 pounds. Junior Mark Dvorak followed the Adamek win with an impressive 9-5 win over Bill McCain at 130. Dvorak opened up his offensive arsenal as he took McCain down twice in each of the first two periods with single legs and duckunders. \"Mark wrestled aggressive and smart,\" suggests coach Ripley. \"It was another big win for him and the team.\" The Panthers would get another big team win at 135 pounds as Tyler Kivel would score a 6-2 win over 6th rated Matt Hirsch. With the scored tied at 2-2 in the third period, Hirsch chose the bottom position to start the third period and that's when Kivel would go to work. The Panther junior rode the Watertown-ML wrestler hard and then cranked him over with a pair of powerful half-nelsons that accounted for two sets of near falls and the win. \"Tyler was close to finishing and scoring on some take downs and that he need to do,\" states coach Ripley. \"He certainly was dominant and tough on top in the third period to get the big win.\" Steamrolling his way to a big win for the Panthers was 140 pounder Tony Valek as the senior scored a 15-0 technical fall over a good sophomore wrestler in Max Poikonen. Valek scored from every position and would widen the gap with reversals and near falls in each of the final two periods. \"Tony is just a complete wrestler,\" sites coach Ripley. \"However, beyond being a complete wrestler, Tony is a great leader and has had a great impact on this team getting to the State Tournament.\" The big wins would keep coming for the Panthers as senior Gabe Dvorak would score a decisive 8-2 win over Jon Dailing at 152 pounds. Dvorak would take a 3-0 lead into the third period and would score a reversal to take a commanding 5-0 lead en route to the victory. \"Gabe really stepped up and wrestled well in the semi final meet against Delano and here in the championship against Watertown-ML,\" responds coach Ripley. \"He wrestled like a Scott West senior with the last name being Dvorak.\" The Dvorak win made it six wins in a row for Scott West and the Panthers would get wins seven and eight not from a Dvorak but from a pair of Fogarty's, cousins Dillon and Connor. Dillion would win a 1-0 rematch over Taylor Neaton at 160 pounds and Connor would do the same with a 4-2 rematch win over Brad Falde at 171. \"They maybe related by blood but their wrestling styles are far from related,\" contends coach Ripley. \"Dillon's going to come straight at you and wrestle you hard with six minutes of basic, fundamental wrestling, while his \"Crazy\" cousin is going take you on roller coaster ride around the mats that you can't even come close to buying at any amusement park in America.\" Watertown-ML's #1 rated Eric Reinert would put an end to the Scott West winning streak as he would down Michael Kroell's at 189 pounds by a score of 16-3. Kroell's, just an 8th grader, put up a good fight and made the Royal wrestler earn his points. \"Michael did a good job of making Reinert earn his points,\" states coach Ripley. \"It's all part of the process and I think some day soon Scott West fans will see Michael Kroells doing the same thing to many of his opponents.\" Senior Alex Krautkremer has been through the process and the Panther wrestler got after Royal wrestler Nate Dickhausen in their third meeting of the year at 215. With the two wrestlers splitting a pair of matches throughout the year, Krautkremer would score early in often in this one as he widened the gap between the two wrestlers by following up a take down with a half nelson that sent Dickhausen to his back, a three-point near fall and an eventual 11-4 Krautkremer win. \"We would have really liked to seen Alex get the pin or the major,\" insists coach Ripley. \"However, this was a very good match for him and it does show that he has been practicing and wrestling well.\" Just a sophomore, Panther heavyweight Travis Hentges has also been wrestling well. Hentges would close out the meet with a solid 6-2 win over Derek Ernst as he used a take down in each of the three periods to win. \"Travis was close to getting some turns and we would have really liked to see that,\" states coach Ripley. \"With that being said, we have really liked the way that Travis has wrestled since the middle of January on.\" Following the Hentges win at heavyweight, the Scott West captains were presented the Section 2AA Team Championship plaque, the enthusiastic Scott West fans flooded the Montgomery gym floor as the State Celebration was on and an echo went throughout all of Scott County: \"We are...SCOTT WEST! ...We are...SCOTT WEST! ...We are...SCOTT WEST!\" Scott West will take to the mats at the St. Paul XCEL Energy Center on Thursday night (February 28th) at 5:00 p.m. with a 27-5 dual meet record this season. The Panthers will face Plainview-Elgin Millville, a team that they beat 45-23 at this year's Clash VI--National Duals in Rochester. \"I don't put too much stock in last time meetings,\" comments coach Ripley. \"There are a lot of variables in high school wrestling and things change, line ups change and you just better have 14 guys that come ready to wrestle if you want to advance to the next round.\" Before the Scott West Wrestling team takes to the mats for their 9th trip to the State Tournament in its 18 year wrestling history, the Panthers will make their way to Delano this weekend for the Section 2AA Individual Tournament with the top two wrestlers in each of the 14 weight classes advancing on to the State Tournament. \"There won't be any free passes,\" states coach Ripley. \"Section 2AA has a long standing history and reputation over the last several years as arguably being the toughest Section in the State, regardless of class.\" The Section 2AA Individual Tournament in Delano will begin with wrestling action at 4:30 p.m. on Friday and at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday.

The Scott West wrestling team upped their record to 24-5 in Belle Plaine on Friday night as the Panthers closed out their regular season of wrestling with a 30-21 win over Minnesota's #7 rated team in Class AA, the Watertown-Mayer Lutheran Royals. \"It was a Royal Battle!\" exclaims Scott West Wrestling coach Darren Ripley. With both teams in Section 2AA, the win will most likely give Scott West the number 1 seed heading into this week's Section 2AA Team Tournament that will be held in Montgomery. \"It was a hard fought meet by both teams and we got a good team effort,\" states coach Ripley. \"The #1 is seed is what we wrestled for tonight,\" claims coach Ripley. \"However, a seed does not put you in the State Tournament and that's what we will be wrestling for next week.\" The \"Royal Battle\" would begin with three battles in the lightweight divisions of 103, 112 and 119. Watertown-Mayer Lutheran would come out on the winning end of all three low scoring matches as the Royals got a win from #3 rated Drew Fleming at 103 as he scored a late, third period reversal to win 4-2 over #4 rated Panther Lee Goldberg. The Fleming win was followed by a 2-1 Joey Stadnick win at 112 as the #7 rated Royal wrestler made a first period take down stand up over Panther Tyler Zilverberg. Tenth-rated Brandon Henrich would make it a sweep of the first three weight classes for the visiting Royals as the 119 pounder held on to a 4-2 win over Jake Siegle. \"We knew coming into the meet that there were going to be several close, hard fought matches,\" insists coach Ripley. \"The fight was on!\" After Drake Matuska gave the Royals a 15-0 team lead by pinning Francis Dvorak in the first period at 125, Mark Dvorak would break the scoring ice for the Panthers as he scored a dramatic 5-4 victory over Bill McCain at 130. Trailing 4-3 with just seven seconds left in the match, Dvorak switched McCain for a match winning reversal that gave the Panthers their first three team points of the meet. \"We needed somebody to break the ice,\" comments coach Ripley. \"I would say that is Mark's biggest win for the team since his 8th grade year when he picked up a couple of big team wins over STMA and Milaca.\" The Dvorak win at 152 gave Scott West its first team lead at 18-15 and Dillon Fogarty would close out the Panther six match winning streak pretty much in the same manner as it had started. Trailing Watertown's Taylor Neaton 2-0 late in the match, Fogarty would be awarded one point for a stalling call and then would reverse the Royal wrestler with less than five seconds remaining in the match to get a 3-2 win at 160. \"We always stress that you have to wrestle six minutes and that you have to score the last points of the period,\" states coach Ripley. \"Fortunately, we were able to do that a couple of times tonight.\" The Royals would come back to tie the team score (21-21) at 171 as #1 rated Eric Reinert would score a third period pin of Kyle McDermand. However, the Panthers would come back to win the last three matches of the meet and secure the 30-21 team win behind Connor Fogarty's 4-0 win over Brad Falde at 189, Alex Krautkremer's 3-2 win over Nate Dickhausen at 215 and Travis Hentges 4-0 win over Derek Ernst at heavyweight. \"Again, all three wrestlers stayed in good position and made points hard to come by,\" states coach Ripley. \"Krautkremer's win was especially big because Dickhausen had defeated him earlier at the Christmas Tournament and it gave us an insurmountable six point team lead in this meet.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Belle Plaine", "latitude": 44.6227, "longitude": -93.7686}, {"name": "Belle Plaine", "latitude": 44.6227, "longitude": -93.7686}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "Watertown", "latitude": 44.9636, "longitude": -93.8472}, {"name": "Mayer", "latitude": 44.885, "longitude": -93.8877}, {"name": "Montgomery", "latitude": 44.4389, "longitude": -93.5813}, {"name": "Watertown", "latitude": 44.9636, "longitude": -93.8472}, {"name": "Mayer", "latitude": 44.885, "longitude": -93.8877}, {"name": "Watertown", "latitude": 44.9636, "longitude": -93.8472}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Bell removed a handgun from his pants as Eggers tried to get hold of Bell's hands in the darkness. Feeling the gun, Officer Eggers grabbed it by the top front, just over the barrel. The two fought for control of the weapon before Eggers, beginning to fear he would lose the fight and his life, drew his own gun. Officer Eggers gave commands for Bell to let go of the gun, pressed his own weapon into Bell's back and when that did not stop Bell, Eggers fired five shots, four of which struck Bell.

The incident happened in a Silverado Ranch neighborhood near Spencer Street and Eldorado Lane. He was listed in stable condition Sunday in the intensive care unit at St. Rose Dominican Hospital-Siena campus, hospital spokeswoman Kim Haley said. Haley said the man was stung a couple thousand times, and it was uncertain how long he would have to remain hospitalized.

McClure gave attorneys until 11 a.m. April 24, when an hearing to review evidence is scheduled, to approve a plea agreement. Fairfield\u2019s trial is to start at 8:30 a.m. May 4 and last five days. McClure said she anticipates the trial \u201cwould require substantially more jurors\u201d than usually called for in a Superior II trial. \u201cIt costs us more than $1,000 just to get a jury here,\u201d she said. Fairfield\u2019s lawyers have already tried to keep the new charges from being field and still question whether the new charges are \u201ctechnically legal,\u201d Schembs said. There are \u201cpropriety issues\u201d over the grand jury\u2019s indictment, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure at this point what they were presented with and what they weren\u2019t; what they did and what they didn\u2019t,\u201d Schembs said. McClure had rejected a motion to strike the new charges, saying the defense had based the request on an out-dated state law. \u201cA new motion to strike is pending,\u201d Schembs said. If the new charges stand, and if she is convicted on all four counts, Fairfield could spend up to 98 years in prison and be fined $35,000. Fairfield has rejected one plea agreement. On Jan. 20, Prosecutor Todd Meyer offered to have her confess to reckless homicide. If she had accepted, and agreed to attend parenting and prescription drug treatment classes, Fairfield would have been released that day. Fairfield declined to plead, maintaining her innocence.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Lebanon", "latitude": 40.0484, "longitude": -86.4692}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

One of the first projects the committee hopes to start is the production of an information pack that contains advice and information useful to the refugee community. Once compiled, they hope to distribute this leaflet to some of the estimated 40,000 Iraqi refugees and many other refugees from Ethiopia, the Philippines, Sudan and Syria, who are not currently registered with the UNHCR. BEIRUT: \"You know, the life of a refugee in Lebanon is such a difficult one,\" explains Haidar. \"We are treated as undesirables, as trouble-makers, even as terrorists. Society is hostile toward us and the authorities don't recognize us as equals; we suffer from abuse, exploitation and the constant fear of arrest.\" The association believes that one of the primary benefits of the center is that it provides refugees with an opportunity to participate directly in the running of the services provided by the NGO. This participatory approach relies on a commitment to allowing refugees to take direct responsibility for the provision and maintenance of services. This week, AMEL took steps in realizing this vision, by organizing a democratic vote to elect a Youth Committee to represent the interests of the NGO's six hundred plus beneficiaries, the first of its kind in Lebanon. He goes on to say that even those refugees who are registered with the UNHCR and possesses UN papers are not safe, seeing as the Lebanese authorities do not recognize the status of refugees and will arrest and detain anyone who is caught. As a result, Sajed concludes, \"many refugees cannot travel, but must remain in or close to their homes in [Beirut's southern suburbs], where the local security forces are sympathetic to their situation.\" The committee hopes that by becoming elected representatives, they can help to break the sense of isolation felt by refugees. Sajed explains the importance of the AMEL center as a safe space where people can meet and relax. \"It is a place where we are able to do the sorts of everyday things that, as refugees, we are normally deprived of.\" Committee members all agree that it is through being at the center, making friends, sharing experiences, offering and asking for advice and engaging in dynamic activities that people are able to stop thinking about themselves as refugees and start to live more normal lives. A combination of this community-based mentality and a participatory approach can be seen in action through the educational and vocational training programs provided by the AMEL center. Instead of recruiting staff from outside, the center aims to recruit trainers and teachers directly from the Iraqi refugee community. For example, one of the committee members, Sajed, a long-term refugee in Lebanon, works at the center as an Arabic literacy and history teacher. Sajed hopes that by reaching out to the community, they will find other people with skills who are willing to share them.

But soon it was her grandfather\u2019s own turn to take to the stage. And when Laurel County Clerk Dean Johnson was inducted into the 5th District\u2019s Lincoln Club Hall of Fame, he beamed at his smiling granddaughter. Johnson was one of four inductees \u2014 and the only Laurel County resident \u2014 welcomed into the prestigious club Saturday. \u201cI feel good about it, naturally,\u201d he said of the honor. Johnson joins fellow inductees state Sen. Tom Jensen, R-London; former commonwealth\u2019s attorney Tom Handy and former senator Gene Huff. But Johnson said he wasn\u2019t sure what clinched the honor for him. \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to help and support the people who run for state and federal offices. I suppose it\u2019s because I\u2019ve tried to be a strong supporter.\u201d Johnson entered the political arena himself in the early 1970s when he ran for sheriff at the age of 31. \u201cI thought there was some room for some younger people,\u201d he said. Though he was defeated by 9 votes, Johnson was immediately hooked to the political game and, soon thereafter, made a bid to fill the county clerk seat. Again, he was narrowly defeated but not discouraged. In 1985, he won the clerk\u2019s seat and has occupied it ever since. Through it all, he has been a staunch Republican supporter, voting for Republican presidents and governors ever since he cast his first vote for Richard Nixon in 1960 at the age of 18. Johnson said he\u2019s admired many Republican presidents in his lifetime, including Dwight Eisenhower. \u201cHe was the greatest and the best we ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cI was about 10 and we studied about him. I think he did a lot to bring this nation into the modern era.\u201d Since, Johnson said he has been a fan of Ronald Reagan and \u201cbelieve it or not, I thought the Bushes did a fine job. \u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand the conditions they\u2019re serving under,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to look at the times before we can be critical of anyone.\u201d Of Saturday\u2019s dinner, Johnson said he enjoyed speeches given by Senate President David Williams, U.S. Rep.

I thought they limited their speech to what they were doing and what they want to see done.\u201d In terms of the future of the Republican party, Johnson is optimistic. \u201cI think they have to sit back and wait,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be situations they can take advantage of.

Audit alleges discrepancies with emergency director over $1.8 million grant After an audit revealed he misspent $1.87 million in federal funds \u2014 much of which went into the coffers of his wife\u2019s company \u2014 Brian Reams has been fired from his position as director of the division of public safety and emergency management. The audit also blames the Laurel County Fiscal Court for lack of oversight. The audit has been referred to the Kentucky Attorney General\u2019s Office, the FBI and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Reams did not respond to a request for comment. Laurel County Judge-Executive Lawrence Kuhl fired Reams at the Emergency Operations Center and asked him to leave the building Tuesday morning. \u201cNaturally, I hate the whole situation,\u201d Kuhl said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it. None of us were aware of it until their findings. It\u2019s a tough decision that has to be made by us and by me.\u201d Fourth-district magistrate Jeff Book expressed his disapproval. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in someone of Mr. Reams\u2019 status, with the magnitude of his position as the EMS director, director of CSEPP, homeland security, just the magnitude of his office, spending federal tax dollars coming into the county for emergency operations and the protection of our citizens being spent for what appears to be other reasons,\u201d he said.Second-district magistrate Tom Baker echoed Book\u2019s sentiment. \u201cI feel anger, disappointment that our county has been dragged into this,\u201d he said. The audit, released by state auditor Crit Luallen\u2019s office, reported the Laurel County Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program received the $1.8 million grant so Reams could buy specific equipment for 10 Kentucky counties. Reams reportedly received two bids for the project, which he opened alone, rather than going through the fiscal court. The contract was ultimately awarded to PREP, a business owned by Melody Vess Reams. Melody Vess and Brian Reams married in June 2008. The equipment purchased by PREP \u2014 Providing Response and Emergency Preparedness \u2014 was far inferior to what was supposed to be bought as per the grant\u2019s specifications. For example, the project called for 40, 8,000-watt generators but PREP delivered 40, 3,000-watt generators. \u201cBased on Internet research for comparable prices, it appears that the invoice also overcharged for these generators by as much as $900 each,\u201d the audit reads. \u201cIt appears CSEPP overpaid at least $35,402 for these generators.\u201d The grant also called for the purchase of 40, 7 foot-by-18 foot Homesteader trailers. Instead, PREP delivered 40 LA Cargo trailers. \u201cQuestions were raised by one county CSEPP coordinator as to whether these were even new trailers due to deteriorated conditions in some areas,\u201d the report reads. Gary Epperson, CSEPP director for Clark County, was taken aback by the equipment he received. \u201cI was one of the people who was a little surprised we weren\u2019t getting what we thought we were getting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were under the impression that we couldn\u2019t get what we wanted. That\u2019s what we were told. It was indicated at some meetings that we were having a cost overrun.\u201d Epperson said Clark County\u2019s trailer looked new but \u201cit wasn\u2019t the brand we thought we were getting. \u201d\u201cI think everybody was concerned it wasn\u2019t exactly what we expected to get,\u201d he said. \u201cThe generators were the thing that stood way out. They weren\u2019t really strong enough to power the equipment.\u201d Nevertheless, PREP submitted an invoice asking for $530,446 to pay for supplies. CSEPP Public Information Officer Monica French said questions arose about the grant in August 2008, shortly after CSEPP Program Coordinator Mark Klaas and Kentucky Department of Emergency Management Director Brig.

However, the Christian report also places blame on the Laurel County Fiscal Court, saying it \u201cdid not properly oversee the bid process, bid award and procurement process. \u201d\u201cAs a result, improprieties occurred,\u201d it reads. The report states, \u201cbids for materials, supplies or equipment must be obtained for expenditures that exceed $20,000.\u201d In the case of the grant, the bids did not even go through the fiscal court. In its finding, the Christian report said the court \u201cshould not engage in related party transactions.\u201d The audit shows in May 2008 a purchase request was forwarded from Reams to the fiscal court for the purchase of parts and maintenance in the amount of $9,996.15. \u201cThe purchase requisition was pending at the time the Director (Reams) became married to the owner of PREP,\u201d it reads.

The bar section at Church & State, a new restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, has a recipe written on a column for drinking absinthe. The restaurant is in the National Biscuit Co. building. If you tried the restaurant when it opened and were disappointed, let me just say this: After a rocky start that ended in the original chef leaving, the restaurant is really humming. Manzke is throwing himself into the bistro genre with gusto. He's making his own charcuterie. He's changing the menu every few days. He's in the zone. For anyone looking for a restaurant downtown that has good food, and feels festive and fun, all without straining the pocketbook too much, that place is Church & State. Manzke is working like someone possessed. He's the guy in the open kitchen with the flattop haircut and an old-fashioned kind of face that wouldn't look out of place on the AMC series \"Mad Men.\" Hands-on all the way, he's even crafting his own hardwood cutting boards for the charcuterie and cheese platters. Originally the loading dock of the 1925 National Biscuit Co. building, the one big dining room has a funky festive look with piazza lights strung across the high ceilings with visible pipes and ducts. Old mirrors and chairs with red leather seats complete the bistro look and tall windows look out onto Industrial Street and the Toy Factory Lofts across the street. The neighborhood can be dicey, but this precious little block is full of life in the dark -- loft dwellers walking their dogs, downtown folks bicycling home, high heels clicking on the sidewalks. With the spangled lights reflected in the windows across the way, this tiny section of the city begins to take on some of the industrial chic of the meatpacking district in New York. The clatter and bang from the kitchen competes with the music pumping out from the sound system -- all you feel is the beat: it's hard to tell what it is. But nobody seems to care: They're too busy eating and drinking, big groups of six or eight friends crowded in at one table, or couples strung out at small tables along the back wall. At one, a slender girl in a tight black vest, short skirt and black stockings toasts her companion and digs into an iced platter of oysters. They're Kumamotos and Kushis from the Northwest, nice and cold, fresh and delicious. Dishes to share The server madly pushes candles, plates, glasses away to clear a space in the middle of the table for the charcuterie presented on a foot-and-a-half-long cutting board. Most of it is made in-house -- lovely rounds of rabbit galantine studded with pistachios, a delicate partridge terrine with truffles, (pig's feet and Kurobuta ham with parsley pressed into a rectangle), slivers of deep red duck breast prosciutto (not all of them are available every day). Manzke also turns out French canning jars filled with pork rillettes (pork cooked in pork fat that's rather on the lean side here) topped with prunes and Armagnac, and fabulously silky and rich foie gras with a layer of Port gel\u00e9e on top. There's peppery , a large rectangular tart topped with sweet caramelized onions, cubes of bacon and Gruy\u00e8re cheese rather than the traditional cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. It's essentially a tomato-less pizza with bacon. What's not to like? More sumptuous even is the tart blanketed in lemon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, leeks and satiny smoked salmon. Not only is the topping terrific, the crust for both the tarts is thin and crunchy. The secret? The pastry is enriched with a little lard. And both tarts are so large, they're too much for just two. Bring a few friends along and share as an appetizer. And sharing is what most makes sense here. Everyone will want to taste everything. Plates fly around the table as someone wants to try the bouillabaisse, which is a kind of miracle. The broth actually tastes like something from the south of France, redolent of flavorful fish and loaded with prawns, mussels and clams. If you're in a crowd, maybe you'd better get two: The portion isn't huge, which is why they can charge just $18. fried in lard, which gives them a wonderful flavor, even though the aioli that comes with them is too wimpy. How can you not love a bistro that proposes herring and potato salad? In this case it's smoked, marinated herring with boiled fingerling potatoes in a bright, vinegary dressing, with flower-shaped carrot slices for some crunch. Sometimes there's a marvelous leek terrine, pretty and green, and served with a thatch of celery root salad. Don't pass up the escargots, an order of six, each served in an adorable tiny blue and white porcelain dish capped with a golden disk of puff pastry. There are plenty to share -- or maybe not, once you dip your spoon into that garlicky snail butter and find out how good snails can be when made by somebody who really knows how to cook. Keeping it simple Manzke has wisely stripped the menu down to a single page, with most main courses under $20. Even the very decent steak frites, which come with house-made b\u00e9arnaise, come in a smaller size -- a for a mere $14 as opposed to $24 for the regular. We're all seeking comfort food right now and chicken \u00e0 la Bourgeoise is just what's required, moist tender chicken roasted with carrots, pearl onions and bacon and served with a splash of the pan drippings.

A chilling report that a Lancaster mother had been knocked unconscious by an attacker and her 18-month-old daughter abducted Wednesday afternoon triggered a frantic search by authorities for the missing child. That search ended nearly a dozen hours later Thursday, though, when police discovered the toddler's body dumped by the side of a road in Sylmar, near the Golden State Freeway. Now, in the wake of the discovery, investigators are saying there are problems with the mother's explanation. Emma Leigh Barker's remains were found by investigators after they determined there \"were several inconsistencies\" with her mother's story, authorities said. The girl's body was found near Roxford Street and El Dorado Avenue, concealed by deep overgrown brush alongside a fence. Authorities said it appeared the girl's 25-pound body had been dumped sometime over the last 24 hours and showed no visible signs of trauma. The girl's mother, Stacy Barker, 20, initially told detectives that she was at a Lancaster park next to the Antelope Valley Freeway about 5 p.m. and had placed Emma in her car seat. The mother said she was \"struck from behind by an unknown assailant\" and knocked unconscious, sheriff's homicide Lt. Pat Nelson said. Barker insisted to detectives she awoke about 10:30 p.m. several miles away at a Palmdale park-and-ride on Avenue S and her daughter was missing. The mother's brother called authorities, and deputies were dispatched to the park-and-ride lot. Deputies found the mother semiconscious and partly undressed with visible bruises on her head, Nelson said. The Sheriff's Department began searching for the girl at 11 p.m. Wednesday. Investigators put out a description of the girl as being 30 inches tall and wearing blue-jean shorts and a multicolored polka dot top. Photos of Emma's smiling face filled Los Angeles television airwaves Thursday morning as investigators conducted a high-profile search for the missing toddler. Sources familiar with the investigation said the mother changed her story by Thursday and was insisting that Emma's death was an accident. Investigators and the county coroner's office must now determine how the girl died. The mother is now helping investigators. \"She is not in custody. She is cooperating with the investigation,\" Nelson said. Barker is \"not considered a suspect\" at this point, he said. \"But that may change\" as the investigation continues, he said. When asked whether there were other persons of interest, Nelson said that investigators were \"working additional leads,\" but \"nobody specific\" was under investigation.

Sixteen days after the election, city officials announced that Measure B had fallen short of a majority -- with 50.5% of voters opposing the plan and 49.5% in favor of it.

The defeat dealt a blow to the hopes of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who had spent $145,000 from a campaign committee on behalf of the measure and appeared in a blitz of television commercials promoting it. But it also was a setback for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whose top officials had proposed Measure B. The union's various locals, nationals and affiliated nonprofit groups had spent more than $673,000 toward its passage -- more than half of the total collected by the Measure B campaign. Labor groups provided two-thirds of the campaign's funding. Measure B would have required the city Department of Water and Power to install 400 megawatts of solar panels by 2014. All the work would have been performed by DWP employees represented by the electrical workers union.

Samra says he barely allowed himself to sleep during college and often works as late as 1 a.m. Background: Samra came to the U.S. in 1980 and went to work on his first day in the country at Micro Peripherals in Chatsworth. Later, as the quality-control manager for a U.S. electronics firm called Flextronics, he held overseas factories to a 100-point efficiency and quality measurement standard, demanding that each subcontractor show improvement in performance annually. He held himself to the same rigid standards when he formed Balqon in 2005. Education: Chemical engineering degree from Panjab University. Samra says he has never used his chemical engineering training and viewed every firm that contracted with his employers as a case study on how to run a business. The problem: Samra's company had the expertise to design its electric vehicle but didn't have the capital or a location suitable for a vehicle assembly line. The breakthrough: In the Port of Los Angeles, Samra found the rough equivalent of a venture capitalist and a technology incubator desperate for answers to Southern California's biggest single source of air pollution. Under an arrangement with the port and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, Balqon got $527,000 in seed money to build and test a prototype. Samra was required to move his company across the county line from Santa Ana to Los Angeles, and he found an office park facility in Harbor City that was large enough to work on several trucks at once. Coming together: The truck chassis arrives pre-assembled, but without an engine or a standard transmission. Power is generated through two trays of seven forklift batteries. Samra doesn't talk about the controller itself or the software that runs it. \"That would be the secret sauce,\" he quips. Hobbies: None. The Laguna Hills resident is so busy with his new truck line that he has time only for work. Bare bones: Walk into the Balqon offices, and no one greets you. The company is hiring engineers first and a receptionist later. Samra's office has that just-moved-in look, even though Balqon relocated seven months ago.

Subtitled \"L.A.'s Unique Spiritual Legacy,\" the tour featured five venues that contributed to the spiritual traditions of the region. As the main title suggested, it was all about people seeking something beyond themselves. In addition to seeing the fellowship on Mount Washington, people who took the driving tour visited the Chapel of Jesus Ethic in Glendale, the Philosophical Research Society in Los Feliz, the Bonnie Brae House in Historic Filipinotown and one of the most recognizable religious buildings in Los Angeles: the domed Angelus Temple in Echo Park. In a printed guide to the tour, Trudi Sandmeier, director of education for the conservancy, wrote, \"As our 'City of Seekers' tour illustrates, our built environment is rich in historic religious sites, both traditional and nontraditional.\" would fall in the latter category. The organization was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian swami who introduced America to yoga and gained a worldwide following with his \"Autobiography of a Yogi. It's said that Yogananda had a vision of the Mount Washington site, which offers commanding views of downtown Los Angeles. As docents explained, the Mount Washington Hotel opened there in 1910 and was connected to the flatlands 940 feet below by an incline railway that was dismantled long ago. In 1925 the Mission Revival-style hotel was purchased by Yogananda, who made the site his headquarters. It remains a center for study and meditation. As one of the docents explained, pointing to parts of the complex, \"Nuns to the right; monks to the left.\" The rich and famous were among Yogananda's friends, including conductor Leopold Stokowski and famed horticulturist Luther Burbank. Which brings us to the cactus. As the story goes, Burbank talked lovingly to a cactus, so reassuring and calming that the plant dropped its needles. A cutting from the cactus was planted at the Self-Realization Fellowship and still flourishes, free of spines. Yogananda blended Eastern traditions, such as breath control, with Christianity. Indeed, visitors to the center's library could see another of his many books, \"The Yoga of Jesus,\" whose cover depicts Jesus sitting in a lotus position. To the west, across the street from the Glendale Galleria, the Chapel of Jesus Ethic offered another example of religious synthesis. The building, with a sweeping roof and lots of windows, is an example of the Modern design school popular in the 1960s. A garden is based on a garden found at Yogananda's fellowship. The complex was built as the centerpiece for the (pronounced NISH-ence), which also blends Christianity with Eastern belief systems and practices, such as meditation. Founded by Colton, who died in 1984 two months shy of her 86th birthday, the foundation also places a premium on the creative arts. The conservancy's tour booklet offered this striking anecdote: \"It was while conducting worship services in the Chapel of the Jesus Ethic on Aug. 12, 1973, that Colton experienced what is described by her followers as a levitation miracle. At this moment, as witnessed by those in the congregation, her body rose into the air and turned over, landing on her back a short distance down the aisle from her original position. She explained that this phenomenon was the power of Christ overtaking her body to demonstrate his physical and spiritual power.\" A short drive away was yet another example of how Angelenos have blended traditions and schools of thought. The , near Griffith Park, was the headquarters of Manly P. Hall, who over six decades wrote more than 200 books on philosophy and spiritual practices. His best-known work was the modestly titled \"The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy.\" The headquarters is a visual encyclopedia of sorts. It was built in Mayan Revival style, but the carved wooden doors to the library feature Confucius and Plato. Statues are modeled on designs from ancient Egypt. Embedded in the courtyard is a bit of tile from in England, thought by some to be the burial site of King Arthur. The next two sites on the tour reflected sweeping movements of Christianity. The Bonnie Brae House west of downtown is a simple cream-colored wood house surrounded by modest homes and apartments. It may not look like much, but this was where the modern Pentecostal movement was born in 1906. Tradition holds that William J. Seymour and some fellow worshipers there were overtaken by the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues. This led to the movement that became known as the could hold 5,300 people when completed in 1923 at the direction of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. The building, a blend of vaguely classical columns and arches contrasted with art deco rectangles, looms over Echo Park. Inside visitors gawked at the two balconies and the 30-foot windows designed by \"Sister Aimee.\" By mid-afternoon, a rock band set up in the sanctuary and began to practice -- loudly -- for a service geared toward a young audience. The tour-takers, who were old enough to have annoyed their own parents by cranking up Rolling Stones albums, could not stand the volume for long and left the sanctuary. But, in a sense, the band was just doing what worshipers did there generations ago, though at a lower decibel level. They were seeking something as well. That's what tied Angelus Temple to the other tour venues. Like that cactus at the swami's retreat, many people are looking for a safe place to grow, a place where there's no need for spines.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "L.A.", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "L.A.", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "Mount Washington", "latitude": 34.0992, "longitude": -118.22}, {"name": "Glendale", "latitude": 34.1425, "longitude": -118.255}, {"name": "Los Feliz", "latitude": 34.1109, "longitude": -118.286}, {"name": "Filipinotown", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Los Angeles", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "Echo Park", "latitude": 34.0725, "longitude": -118.261}, {"name": "America", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Mount Washington", "latitude": 34.0992, "longitude": -118.22}, {"name": "Los Angeles", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "Mount Washington", "latitude": 34.0992, "longitude": -118.22}, {"name": "Glendale", "latitude": 34.1425, "longitude": -118.255}, {"name": "Griffith Park", "latitude": 34.1358, "longitude": -118.301}, {"name": "Egypt", "latitude": 27.0, "longitude": 30.0}, {"name": "England", "latitude": 54.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "Echo Park", "latitude": 34.0725, "longitude": -118.261}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u00e2 \u201d Tens of thousands of Kansas utility customers were without power Saturday and two deaths were reported as an early spring blizzard buried parts of Kansas in snow and ice. A 72-year-old man Hutchinson man was shoveling snow and died of an apparent heart attack Saturday, according to the adjutant general's office. On Friday, a 58-year-old woman was killed in a car accident on icy roadways in Marion County. '' Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this storm,'' Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said in a news release. '' Many roads in our state are still treacherous, so please be careful as you travel and take extra precautions when walking or working in the current conditions.'' The storm, which dropped several inches of snow around Riley County Friday night and Saturday, did little damage locally, officials said. '' We haven't had any calls,'' said Emergency Management Director Pat Collins. '' There were no roads closed, we haven't been busy at all.'' Collins said crews were out early to prepare roads around the county. Police officials said there were several non-serious wrecks on Interstate 70, but that drivers stayed indoors for the most part. Westar Energy said about 12,700 customers were without power as of about 8:30 p.m. Saturday. The utility said it had restored power to more than 60,000 customers since the storm began, with some customers experiencing multiple outages. Kansas Electric Cooperatives Inc. said five rural electric cooperatives were reporting outages to a combined 5,000 meters, which can serve multiple homes and businesses. Kansas City Power & Light was reporting 2,300 consumers were in the dark, primarily in Anderson County. Most of the utility problems were in south-central Kansas, where up to an eighth of an inch of ice was causing tree branches to snap and knocking down power lines. Ice accumulations were from a quarter inch to an inch across the Flint Hills and parts of southeast Kansas. Much of the state was dealing with heavy snow and a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The National Weather Service said the heaviest snow had fallen in parts of southwest Kansas, including 28 inches in the Pratt area with six-foot snow drifts. '' There's a good swath of our area that's covered with at least a foot of snow,'' said Matt Girard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Dodge City. Heavy winds accompanying the snow diminished visibility in many communities to almost zero and forced authorities to close several local and state highways. Still, the storm was blamed for numerous accidents. Much of central, eastern and southeastern Kansas were reporting a foot and a half or less of snow but were more concerned about the freezing rain making driving even more challenging. The Kansas Department of Transportation said several highways were closed in southwest Kansas due to poor visibility and blowing snow, including long stretches of such major routes as U.S. 54, 56, 83, 160, 183, 283 and 400. Part of U.S. 83 south out of Garden City was reopened, as was U.S. 50 west of Dodge City. Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the adjutant general, said a guard search and rescue team in Pratt County reported rescuing two stranded motorists near Pratt. The adjutant general's office also reported that emergency crews in Hutchinson responded to three partially collapsed building. Partial building collapses also were reported in Harvey, Harper and Kingman counties, but no injuries were reported. The Highway Patrol also sent out a plane Saturday to fly over areas of southwest and south-central Kansas to look for stranded drivers. And National Guard helicopters were assisting with search and rescue efforts. The National Guard also opened armories in Dodge City, Great Bend, Hutchinson, Kingman, Larned, Pratt and West Wichita Saturday as warming stations.

More than 60 firefighters and police received awards for their acts of bravery in 2008, such as saving babies from burning buildings, snatching swimmers from rough seas and pulling people out of wrecked cars. CBS4 anchor Michael Williams presented dozens of awards, including one to firefighter Anthony Oro, who held onto a woman's hand for two hours on May 14 beneath the sweltering sun while fellow firefighters cut away at the car in which she was trapped. Another award was given to firefighter and diver Augustin Hondares, whose Fire Rescue unit responded April 20 when a child's parents were trapped under water in a car. Hondares drove to the canal, so he had no time to put on his scuba gear. He instead held his breath, dove into the cold, murky water and pulled out one passenger. He then dove back in, located the second passenger, and had Lt. Richard Rosell pull the man out. Although both parents later died at the hospital, Hondares, Rosell and others received awards for their heroic efforts. DiGiacomo credited teamwork for helping firefighters save two people from the burning yacht. '' We couldn't fathom not getting them out,'' he said. Those thoughts ``can't even creep in.'' Fire Chief Herminio Lorenzo said the firefighters earned their awards by taking their skills and sense of honor with them to all places, on and off the job.

Mar. 21 -- The smoke is back -- and with it the need for drivers to check conditions before they hit the road. A rapidly growing brush fire made commuting an ordeal for drivers on Interstate 4 on Friday night and threatens to close the highway today between DeLand and Daytona Beach if winds flare up as expected. '' It's [the weather] so unpredictable, we never know when we're going to have to shut it down,'' said Sgt. Kim Miller, a Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman. Fifteen brush fires were burning in Volusia County on Friday, and another was under control in Osceola. The largest, spanning 800 acres near State Road 44, was first reported March 6 and was caused by people, according to the U.S. Forestry Service Web site. It doubled in size from Thursday morning to Friday night, said Shelley Szafraniec, a Volusia County spokeswoman. It is in a wooded, swampy area near DeLand difficult for firefighters to reach, she said. The blaze was within an eighth of a mile of I-4, but officials said they didn't plan to close the road unless it burned closer. Motorists were advised to slow down and use their lights if visibility dims. '' People need to use caution in this area,'' Szafraniec said. The flames, fanned by high winds, jumped a line that firefighters plowed. They weren't visible from the road. But smoke could be seen -- and smelled -- as far away as north Seminole County. Eight Florida Highway Patrol troopers were monitoring conditions. If flames burn across the highway, the road would be closed between I-95 and S.R. 472, Miller said. Dry weather is expected to continue until the rainy season starts in mid-May, said Bob Wimmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Melbourne. Winds, which are expected to kick up to 20mph this afternoon, won't help. '' Conditions have been dry, and we're getting into the driest part of our year,'' he said. A La Nina weather pattern is partly to blame, said Tony Cristaldi, another weather-service meteorologist. The phenomenon, which shifts Pacific Ocean temperatures and North American wind patterns, usually turns the rain spigot off for Florida during the winter and spring. The system is weakening, but ''the atmosphere doesn't instantaneously react,'' Cristaldi said. ``We're expected to stay dry right through the spring.'' The Florida Division of Forestry is working to control the flames with help from Volusia County firefighters, said Timber Weller of the forestry division. '' Being this dry, and the humidity being low, makes it very difficult to stop a fire,'' he said. ``The conditions are really stacked against them [firefighters] right now.'' Meanwhile, a 300-acre-plus brush fire was contained by Friday night in east Osceola County. The fire is near Crabgrass, Owens and Harris roads east of rural Holopaw, county spokeswoman Niki Whisler said. One or two dozen homes are nearby but are not in immediate danger, she said. '' One problem we have is the wind keeps shifting,'' Whisler said. The fire started Thursday, died down and flared again Friday.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Orlando", "latitude": 28.5383, "longitude": -81.3792}, {"name": "DeLand", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Daytona Beach", "latitude": 29.2108, "longitude": -81.0228}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Volusia County", "latitude": 29.0836, "longitude": -81.2081}, {"name": "Osceola", "latitude": 28.042, "longitude": -81.1242}, {"name": "Volusia County", "latitude": 29.0836, "longitude": -81.2081}, {"name": "DeLand", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Seminole County", "latitude": 28.7086, "longitude": -81.2081}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Melbourne", "latitude": 28.0836, "longitude": -80.6081}, {"name": "Pacific Ocean", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "North American", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Volusia County", "latitude": 29.0836, "longitude": -81.2081}, {"name": "Osceola County", "latitude": 28.042, "longitude": -81.1242}, {"name": "Crabgrass", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Owens", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Harris", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Holopaw", "latitude": 28.1358, "longitude": -81.0762}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum appears in nearly every frame of a 30-second, widely run commercial warning parents and children about sex offenders online. '' This ad needed a message. It needed a messenger,'' he said Thursday. ``It couldn't be just done with words.'' But Gov. Charlie Crist and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink -- whose public service announcements were nominated for regional Emmy awards last year -- stayed out of the ads. And unlike McCollum, a Republican who hired his 2006 campaign media consultant to produce and air his ad, Crist and Sink sought competitive bids for the ad contracts. '' CFO Sink wanted to make sure Floridians were getting the best deal possible, so she required a competitive bidding process,'' said Kyra Jennings, a spokeswoman for the Democratic officeholder. ``There's also a big distinction from the attorney general's ads in that they feature him so prominently.'' McCollum's $1.4 million media blitz has become a target for the Florida Democratic Party, which says the ads cross the line from public service announcements into political commercials. Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff singled out a $550 expenditure for makeup among the production costs. '' While the attorney general claims that this ad campaign was about promoting public safety, it shouldn't take a $550 makeup job in a vain attempt to make him look good politically,'' he said. McCollum is expected to run for reelection in 2010, though he may run for governor if Crist does not seek another term. Asked about the makeup after he did a cybercrime presentation at Westpine Middle School in Sunrise, McCollum said, ``I didn't know how much the makeup artist costs. It's a package . . . the makeup comes with it.'' In his most extensive comments on the ads since The Miami Herald wrote about them last week, McCollum emphasized that they were bought not with tax dollars, but with money from settlements with companies accused of hiding the costs of cellphone services. The ads run by Crist and Sink were funded with taxpayer money. McCollum said he hired his former campaign consultant, Chris Mottola, because the state's competitive bidding process was ''very slow, very complicated.'' He cited an exemption in state law that allows him to use a no-bid contract for ``artistic services.'' The ad shows McCollum speaking directly to the camera about the dangers of Internet sex predators, with children walking school hallways and using a laptop in the background. '' The development of the ad is artistic. It's how you present it,'' McCollum said. ``You got 30 seconds to be able to tell somebody something.'' The governor's ''Explore Adoption'' campaign last year included five different television videos, including one featuring a boy with his adoptive father at the batting cages. The cost of producing and airing the videos, as well as related radio and billboard ads, was about $650,000. Sink's ''My Safe Florida Homes'' ads, which cost $1.06 million, show consumers on their computers applying for free hurricane inspections. For the attorney general's ads, Philadelphia-based Mottola received 10 percent of the cost of the television time, plus about $38,000 for production, according to McCollum's office. That means he earned about $136,000 on the deal -- more than the $87,511 he was paid by McCollum during the 2006 campaign. '' We felt as a team that we had the very best in the business to make this film at a very good price,'' McCollum said. ```I would expect if we continue to run this ad we would probably use him again to make the buy.'' McCollum has approval from the Florida Legislature to spend another $1.1 million in settlement cash on the cybercrime ad. It is currently airing in South Florida in English and Spanish, where it ran for part of January and all of February. It also ran for six weeks over the summer in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Pensacola, Panama City and Gainesville. McCollum's office released an e-mail from a mother who said that until she saw the ad, she didn't know where to turn when her daughter received naked pictures on her cellphone. '' The good news is that we've gotten their attention,'' McCollum said. ``I don't care if anyone wants to criticize the ad. It's been effective.''", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Floridians", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Sunrise", "latitude": 26.134, "longitude": -80.1131}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Philadelphia", "latitude": 39.9523, "longitude": -75.1638}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "South Florida", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Tampa", "latitude": 27.9475, "longitude": -82.4584}, {"name": "Orlando", "latitude": 28.5383, "longitude": -81.3792}, {"name": "Jacksonville", "latitude": 30.3322, "longitude": -81.6556}, {"name": "Tallahassee", "latitude": 30.4383, "longitude": -84.2807}, {"name": "Pensacola", "latitude": 30.4213, "longitude": -87.2169}, {"name": "Panama City", "latitude": 30.1588, "longitude": -85.6602}, {"name": "Gainesville", "latitude": 29.6516, "longitude": -82.3248}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Major airlines are slashing prices and grounding planes to remain profitable in the tough global economy. But a group of investors believe that the time is ripe to launch a new airline offering flights between New York and St. Petersburg. Baltia Air Lines has won approval from the U.S. Transportation Department to provide nonstop service between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and St. Petersburg's Pulkovo 2 Airport, and the flights will start this summer, the airline's chief executive, Igor Dmitrowsky, told The Moscow Times. The airline will initially offer the round-trip flights once a week on a Boeing 747, later expanding to three days per week and then five days per week, Dmitrowsky said. The eight-hour flight will be the first direct connection between St. Petersburg and any city in North America, which Dmitrowsky sees as an unfilled niche that will give the airline an advantage. Dmitrowsky said the economic downturn would also make Baltia competitive. \"Frankly, these are the best of times for us. The fuel price has gone down dramatically, and the other costs are not so extreme,\" Dmitrowsky said by telephone from New York. \"Can you imagine if we were living in an era where Pan Am was flourishing along with other major airlines with no debt?\" he said. \"We would have such a hard time breaking into the market and an even harder time staying afloat.\" Baltia intends to offer three-class service in its aircraft, which will feature a white fuselage with a red tail emblazoned with a white rooster, representing punctuality. The airlines currently offering direct flights to the United States -- Aeroflot, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines -- provide two-class service. A fourth carrier, United Airlines, will start flights to Russia next Sunday after postponing the Washington-Moscow route last year because of high fuel costs. Oil prices have dropped from a high of about $150 last summer to around $50 last week. But the financial crisis has since enveloped the global economy, discouraging business and leisure travel and forcing airlines to cut prices and capacity. Last week, United Airlines slashed prices to mark the start of the new daily flights between Washington's Dulles Airport and Moscow's Domodedovo Airport. Sample fares on the airline's web site show one-way tickets to Moscow via Dulles costing $119 from New York and $167 from Los Angeles. The tickets must be purchased by Thursday, and travel is between March 29 and April 30. Several other airlines dropped their prices below $500 for round-trip flights to Moscow last week, said Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com. Seaney linked the price cuts to the crisis. \"You have to understand that this is an absolutely crazy airfare environment,\" he said in a column on the ABC News web site. \"The airlines are trying to fill up their planes, but people are procrastinating -- while others just aren't flying. ... So we get the yo-yo price game: When nobody's buying tickets, prices take a dive.\" He said he found American Airlines offering one round-trip fare of $205 from Baltimore to Moscow. Baltia's ticket costs will remain \"along the lines of the current price structure on carriers with connecting services,\" Dmitrowsky said. But Baltia's web site is already promoting a host of discounts to students, seniors and youth. During the first month of service, all passengers will receive 25 percent off the ticket cost, and the first 300 passengers to book flights will receive a free ticket for future use. The date for Baltia's inaugural flight remains to be set, pending approval of its air certification documents from the Federal Aviation Authority, Dmitrowsky said. He said approval was expected within three months. The airline, based in Rego Park, New York, will start service with a single 747. It hopes to start nonstop flights between New York and Moscow, Kiev, Minsk and Riga next year. Dmitrowsky, a U.S. citizen born in Riga, founded a kefir company in 1979 and led it to a public offering in 1986. He has financed several aircraft and automotive projects, but his dream for nearly 15 years has been to launch Baltia. Baltia's shares, which trade on the \"over-the-counter bulletin board\" electronic system, closed up 20 percent at $0.04 on Friday after seeing a 52-week low of $0.01 on Nov. 12 and a high of $0.07 on March 24. Dmitrowsky faces an uphill battle. Airlines could lose more than $2.5 billion in 2009 after cargo volume dropped by 23 percent and passenger traffic fell by 5.6 percent in January, the International Air Transport Association said last week. Aviation industry insiders questioned the wisdom of United Airlines' plans to fly to Russia when they were announced last year, noting that flights between Moscow and the United States were rarely filled. United Airlines said at the time that planes on the Moscow flights would carry a combination of passengers and freight, making the route profitable. American Airlines started flights to Moscow from its home base in Chicago last year. Delta has been flying between Moscow and two U.S. cities, New York and Atlanta, for years.

MAKHACHKALA -- Three days of intense fighting between police and insurgents in a wooded area of Dagestan ended Saturday with five officers and about a dozen militants left dead, officials said. Clashes are frequent in Dagestan, but the fighting in an area near the border with Georgia and Azerbaijan was some of the most intense in recent months. Helicopter gunships fired on the militant positions. Regional Interior Ministry spokesman Mark Tolchinsky said 14 insurgents were killed, but Interfax cited the Federal Security Service as saying 12 died. \"The group committed several crimes in two regions in Dagestan,\" Dagestani Interior Minister Adilgirei Magomedtagirov told reporters. \"There are at least three non-Russians with Arab nationality among the dead militants, perhaps even four,\" he said. State-owned Vesti-24 television showed a row of dead rebels lying in the snow with Kalashnikov rifles slung across their limp shoulders. Magomedtagirov said a collection of Kalashnikov rifles, machine guns and a sniper rifle were found where the militants were hiding. Earlier, television showed helicopter gunships firing from the snowy skies at targets in a forest and armored vehicles rolling into the mountainous area. The police action, which began Wednesday, came after officials in the regions complained to regional authorities about the presence of the gunmen. Underscoring the seriousness of the fighting, state-run television prominently showed a meeting Friday between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Dagestan's leader, Mukhu Aliyev. In the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala, police fatally shot four men Friday who failed to stop their car at a checkpoint and began shooting at officers, city police spokesman Shamil Guseinov said. The bodies of the four were shown on television lying among shattered glass near a battered, white Lada car. Dagestan's militants are seen as having been inspired by separatists in neighboring Chechnya. The fighting is the latest round of violence to plague the North Caucasus, pitting criminal gangs, Islamic militants or feuding clans against one another or against government and police forces.

Murmansk Governor Yury Yevdokimov resigned abruptly Saturday after enduring a week of harsh criticism from United Russia over the loss of the Murmansk mayoral election to an independent candidate. President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed Yevdokimov's resignation and appointed Federal Fisheries Agency deputy head Dmitry Dmitriyenko as the acting governor, the Kremlin said. Political analysts said it was the first instance that a regional leader had been forced out of office for supporting a non-United Russia candidate in an election. Independent candidate Sergei Subbotin, a former Murmansk deputy governor, was elected mayor with 61 percent of the vote in a runoff election on March 15, well over the 35 percent collected by the United Russia candidate, incumbent Mayor Mikhail Savchenko. After the election, the new mayor refused to join United Russia but declared himself a supporter of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who heads United Russia. Yevdokimov, a United Russia member, had served as Murmansk governor since 1996 and was appointed by then-President Putin to a fourth term in 2007. In an interview with Gazeta. ru on Thursday, he denied speculation that he would step down. But on Saturday, he said he thought that it would be best for the country if he quit. \"I've always been ready to bear responsibility for my actions,\" he said, Interfax reported. Senior United Russia officials had accused him of violating election law by offering support for the non-United Russia candidate on local television and threatened to throw him out of the party. United Russia said in a weekend statement on its web site that Yevdokimov had resigned on his own accord. The acting governor, Dmitriyenko, 46, served in submarine units of the Navy from 1980 to 1992 and was appointed as deputy head of the Federal Fisheries Agency last year. United Russia welcomed Dmtiriyenko's appointment. \"There is a need for professionals able to work in new ways during crisis conditions,\" party official Sergei Neverov said in the web site statement. Dmitriyenko will be sworn in as governor on Wednesday, pending confirmation by the regional legislature, which is controlled by United Russia. Dmitriyenko flew to Murmansk on Saturday to meet with regional United Russia officials. In his first official statement as acting governor, Dmitriyenko said he would focus on ways to make regional spending more effective. Alexei Titkov, regions analyst at the Institute of Regional Politics, said the shuffle was the first time that a governor has been replaced after a conflict with United Russia over support of a candidate in elections. \"Yevdokimov's resignation will become an example for the other governors,\" Titkov said. The resignation follows a series of replacements started when Medvedev dismissed four governors in February. The president has the right to appoint and dismiss governors under a law proposed by Putin in 2004. Meanwhile, the State Duma on Friday approved in a final third reading a bill that would give the party that holds the most seats in a regional legislature the right to propose gubernatorial candidates. Under the existing procedure, this right belongs to the presidential envoys to the federal districts. The bill, which now must be approved by the Federation Council and then the president, says the party should propose at least three candidates to the president no later than 90 days before the incumbent governor's term expires. If the president doesn't select anyone from this group within a month, the party must propose three more candidates. If the party doesn't do this, the president can select the candidate himself. Also, the president is not obliged to select a candidate from those proposed by the party. The bill was sent to the Duma in December by Medvedev. United Russia controls nearly all the regional legislatures in Russia.

The opposition has stepped up pressure on President Mikheil Saakashvili since Georgia's disastrous defeat by Russia in a five-day war last August and plans a series of protests beginning on April 9 to demand his resignation. The Interior Ministry said 10 people had been arrested on charges of purchasing automatic weapons, including some \"not very high-ranking\" members of the Democratic Movement-United Georgia party led by former Saakashvili ally Nino Burjanadze. Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said police were not specifically linking the arrests to the planned protests. \"We don't claim this to be a political conspiracy,\" he said. \"The only thing we know is that there are people who have expressed interest in buying weapons and have bought weapons. \"This [the police operation] is aimed at preventing any possible violence in the future and to make sure the political processes don't get interrupted by violence that might come from a thousand different sources. \"Police showed journalists about 20 minutes of secretly filmed video of what it said were the suspects buying weapons, which included automatic rifles.

According to the statements of the Olympic organizers, Russia is not going to abandon its initial plans and obligations related to the Winter Olympic Games 2014 organization in Sochi. The budgets of the Olympic projects, financed either by the state or private investors, are subjected to the review only in connection with the construction budget reduction. But the most burning issue is related to the land plot allocation of the Olympic facilities. It is worth noting that according to the law, the Program for Sochi Development and Olympic Facilities Construction and the data of the organization that carries out the Olympic facilities area planning scheme design and approval (Giprogor Federal State Unitary Enterprise), there is an already determined plot allocation for the Olympic facilities and other building with serve a function to the Olympic facilities. The land plots within the boundaries stated in the approved construction plan, are subject to withdrawal for public needs on the basis of the resolution of the Governor of Krasnodar. The land plots, as well as objects located there, are bought from the private owners on the basis of a market value appraisal report. After the IOC Valuation Committee visit to Sochi in February 2007, the authorities promised to buy land plots from inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay, whose land plots were predominantly those subject to withdrawal at the market value, but a year and a half later no land plots purchase agreements had been supplied to their owners. Although according to the laws there is a 20-day window for drafting a purchase agreement upon receipt of an appraiser's report. The department responsible for organizing the Olympic Games in the Krasnodar area responds to the official inquiries that the delays in the statutory period for drafting purchase agreements is caused by the need to update appraisal reports on the market value of the objects to be bought. It should be noted that the process of land plot title registration in Sochi is particularly inefficient in terms of time and money. For this reason many inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay haven't yet registered their land title in a proper way, or they are still in the process of registering their land title. In this case, there is no talk of market value or even of reasonable compensation; there is social tension, which has lead to numerous protests. Litigations on invalidating the resolution of the Governor of the Krasnodar area concerning land plots withdrawal haven't been realized, as a great number of legislative innovations, meant for simplifying the Olympic construction process, give opportunities for administrative discretion, when applied, but, unfortunately, at the same time they do not supply any protection of the titleholders' rights. And the judges have demonstrated their position clearly -- if a decree violates an applicant's legal rights or interests, but it formally complies with the law, there are no grounds for its invalidation. If the Olympic object arrangement only affects some insignificant part of the land plot, it is reasonable not to withdraw it in full, but to introduce a paid fixed easement, for example, i.e. a restricted right to use the land plot for public needs. Such an easement introducing procedure is organizationally simpler, and requires minimum of budget assets. In terms of the financial crisis, all the executors of the Olympic project continue to emphasize the need for costs optimization and more efficient use of the existing opportunities. Financing difficulties, significant reduction of credit assets leads to an inevitable decrease in investors, who undertake truly \"Olympic\" obligations. And the state suggests to the existing investors that construction volumes should be correspondingly increased. Thus, the Turkish company Kolin, which won the tender for constructing the sea port cargo zone, will have to equip yachting in the harbor waters now.

Ever since New London Police Chief Tom Cipolli made a public appeal to keep his job, New Londoners have been asking why Mayor Mike McBeth has been seeking to remove him. The mayor had planned to lay out his case at a public hearing on Tuesday, more than three months after the issue became public; but a 3-2 vote by the city council delayed that hearing until April, visibly frustrating McBeth and many of the 60 residents who turned out in search of answers. Neither McBeth nor Cipolli has publicly addressed the specific complaints behind McBeth\u2019s request to dismiss the chief. But the Mt. Pleasant News has reviewed legal documents filed as evidence in the matter, and Cipolli\u2019s formal response, which provide the clearest and most comprehensive look so far at the dispute between the two men. The files that accompany McBeth\u2019s request cite 21 different reasons that McBeth was to cite in support of the action \u2013 alleging improper conduct, poor management of the police force, insubordination, untruthful statements to police and city officials and general incompetence. Cipolli, who has called McBeth's accusations \"false and misleading,\" offers a broad response, including a look back at his nearly two years leading the New London Police Department, while responding to several of the claims made in McBeth's case. \"I strongly believe that I have changed the department for the better,\" Cipolli writes, asserting that crime in New London has fallen during his tenure, to which he credited better training and improved professionalism within the department and stronger relationships with the community. \"These positive relationships continue today,\" he writes, \"as do my efforts to insure New London is a safe community. \"The 119-page request includes seven affidavits, two from New London police officers, four from area residents and one from Winfield police chief John Chaney.

He said the Texas State Demographer feels population is shifting from rural areas into cities above the 5,000 level. Board members decided that, rather than change the methodology of making population estimates, they would stay with the current figures until revised by the 2010 federal census. Another report being prepared is on the utilization of the region's brackish water, reported Flemons. The draft reports will be ready by mid-May, he said, in time for board members to read them before the next meeting. The board also heard a presentation from the City of Canton, which is planning to build a new city reservoir to meet it projected population needs.

Marie, Ontario, to be exact, where he grew up. His mother's family was from Michigan, but he had an uncle who lived in Houston, and when he was young, he would him. Like so many transplants, his move to Texas was later partially motivated by the weather. \"I got tired of Canadian winters,\" he laughs. \"I liked the good climate like we have in Texas.\" He said he knew he wanted to be a physician from an early age. \"I was fascinated by medicine, I always knew I wanted to go into medicine. \"After he received his degree in internal medicine from the University of Toronto in 1992, he spent three years at McGill University in Montreal doing his dermatological residencyHe said he was proud to be accepted to study dermatology at McGill, one of the most prestigious universities in Canada. \"It's top notch and very competitive, it's very hard to get in there. \"Of all the sub-specialties in medicine, dermatology is one of the broadest because there are so many medical conditions that can manifest symptoms on the surface. A dermatologist needs to be familiar with at least 2,000 different conditions that might show signs or symptoms on or through the skin. \"You have to know a lot of internal medicine,\" he explains. He said he realized as soon as he started practicing in Mount Pleasant there was a great need to be served. People were traveling to Sulphur Springs, Greenville and as far as Dallas for their dermatological care. \"I've been super busy,\" he said, but he gets a lot of satisfaction from his work. The nature of dermatology is that his work usually shows results immediately, and patients are appreciative of that. \"You usually don't see chronic of end-stage illnesses,\" he said. \"You usually see results right away. \"Of course, skin cancer is one of the most common diseases he treats. It's not necessarily because of the blistering Texas sun, he notes. \"It's because there's a lot of fair-skinned people in Texas. \"He likes to keep up-to-date with the latest treatments, and he's proud to use the Mohs' surgery technique for skin cancer. Mohs surgery is microscopically controlled surgery that is highly effective for common types of skin cancer, with a cure rate cited by most studies between 97% and 99.8%. The Mohs procedure provides precise removal of the cancerous tissue, while healthy tissue is spared. It is essentially a pathology sectioning method that allows for the complete examination of the cancerous area. Dr. Greco says he is very satisfied with how well the Mohs' procedure cuts down on the skin cancer recurrence rate. Like all dermatologists, he says we should all protect ourselves from the sun. Every blistering sunburn causes permanent damage to skin cells, and constant exposure will make you age so much faster, he notes. Another problem he says is common, at least in this area, are tick bites. \"You'd be amazed, I've seen three people already this week with tick bites,\" he said. Tick bites can be potentially serious because ticks transmit Lyme Disease. He said he usually automatically starts tick bit victims on antibiotics.

CARTHAGE, N.C. (AP) - Investigators are looking into whether a gunman accused of killing eight people in a North Carolina nursing home may have targeted the facility because his estranged wife worked there, police said Monday. Carthage Police Chief Chris McKenzie said the woman, who he did not name, worked at the nursing home. He said he believed that the couple were recently separated but that he did not have any other details. He was not sure if the woman was at the nursing home at the time of the shootings. Authorities said Robert Stewart, 45, went on a terrifying rampage in the Pinelake Health and Rehab center on Sunday morning, killing seven residents and a nurse and wounding three others. \"We're certainly looking into the fact that it may be domestic-related,\" McKenzie told The Associated Press ahead of a Monday morning news conference in this small town about 60 miles southwest of Raleigh in North Carolina's Sandhills region. An ex-wife of Stewart's, Sue Griffin, told reporters Sunday she had not had contact with him since they divorced in 2001 but that he had \"violent tendencies\". Griffin added she didn't know how her ex-husband was connected to the nursing home or why he would shoot people there. The injured included a police officer hailed as a hero for stopping the gunman by shooting and wounding him before more people could be killed. Officials said the shooting could have been bloodier if 25-year-old Carthage Police Officer Justin Garner hadn't wounded Stewart while trading gunfire in a hallway. Garner was wounded in the leg. \"He acted in nothing short of a heroic way today, and but for his actions, we certainly could have had a worse tragedy,\" said Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger. \"We had an officer, a well-trained officer, who performed his job the way he was supposed to and prevented this from getting even worse than it is now. \"Griffin, Stewart's ex-wife, said Stewart had been recently reaching out to family members, telling them he had cancer and was preparing for a long trip and to \"go away.\" Krueger said the victims were Pinelake residents Tessie Garner, 88; Lillian Dunn, 89; Jessie Musser, 88; Bessie Hendrick, 78; John Goldston, 78; Margaret Johnson, 89; Louise Decker, 98; and nurse Jerry Avent, whose age wasn't immediately available. Beverly McNeill said her mother, Pinelake resident Ellery Chisholm, called moments after the gunman stormed into her room and pointed his \"deer gun\" at her roommate. \"They're up here shooting, they're up here shooting,\" Chisholm frantically told her 14-year-old granddaughter, Tavia, over the phone, McNeil said. Chisholm told her daughter that she hid her face in her shirt so she couldn't see the man or what she expected him to do, McNeill said. He didn't shoot, but left the room and began shooting down the hallway. The facility was closed after the attack as authorities worked to gather evidence inside and out. Krueger declined to say if authorities had moved the surviving residents from the 110-bed facility, including patients with Alzheimer's disease, saying only, \"They're safe, which is the primary thing. \"Among the items investigators found was a camouflaged-colored rifle or shotgun, which was leaning against the side of a Jeep Cherokee in the parking lot.

BY RUSS ZIMMER Advocate Reporter March 15, 2009 NEWARK -- Unfortunately, it's not an unusual sight -- a child walking toward the witness stand, usually with something in his or her grip, like a stuffed animal or an adult's hand. The child climbs up into the chair, feet not even touching the floor, preparing to talk about something of a very adult nature. Six minors took the stand in their capacity as alleged victims in rape trials in 2007 and 2008, according to data gathered by The Advocate. Many more testified against defendants facing lesser offenses or were interviewed by medical professionals and law enforcement for those cases. Over the past month, juries acquitted two men accused of sexual conduct with a child younger than 13. Doubt was cast on the strength of the state's cases, including inconsistencies in the victims' testimony compared to previous statements and the investigators' methods. Children in each case were required to divulge the alleged conduct, answer legally necessary questions and be subject to cross-examination, all in front of strangers and in front of the defendant. Licking County Prosecutor Ken Oswalt said the convergence of all these elements make an adult victim nervous, let alone a child. These factors can make their testimony unpredictable and sometimes damaging to a case, he said. For those reasons, Oswalt said his office wants to avoid putting children who already have suffered a life-changing experience in that situation. \"We're not in the business of trying to further traumatize kids. ... We're in the business of trying to get people held accountable for the things they do,\" he said. After a child initially discloses abuse and it is reported to authorities, the child usually is taken to Kids' Place, which is a division of Licking Memorial Hospital. There, he or she will receive a physical exam much like any other trip to the doctor's office, but the child will be engaged in a conversation about the allegations, according to testimony in both trials. Newark police Detective Robert Huffman, who has been handling sexual offense investigations for 17 years, said the age of the child greatly affects the wording of the questions. \"The younger the child is, the more steps you have to take to guard against leading the child in any way,\" he said. \"What I try to do is let the child tell me what they want to tell me, really nothing more than that.\" Oswalt said his office tries to limit the number of interviews conducted and officials involved to minimize the embarrassment a child might feel. From Day 1, victims are offered aid through Licking County Victims' Services, which includes trial preparation, Victims' Services Director Mark Weiner said. He said his office tries to educate children about what to expect so they don't feel overwhelmed when they are called to testify. Sometimes they wonder why they have to talk to a room full of people, Weiner said. \"We tell them sometimes bad things happen and you got to go up there and tell the judge,\" he said. The relative tranquility of the witness waiting room alters the second the doors to the courtroom swing open and 14 jurors, attorneys, the judge, the court reporter and observers all are watching as the children make their way to the witness stand. Another set of eyes, the defendant's, also are fixed upon the accuser. Much of the possible inconsistencies in a child's statement might arise from this pressure, Oswalt said. Keep in mind the vast majority of these children are victimized by close relations, he added. \"That puts a young child in a situation of having competing interests or feelings -- maybe one of those is guilt,\" Oswalt said. \"It's a huge dynamic.\" Most of the discrepancies in a child's story heard in court are inconsequential to the question of guilt or innocence, he said. Children might not even consider details of the event important to an adult to be memorable, Oswalt added. \"Daddy touched me and it was yucky,\" he said referring to a typical reaction by an abused child. Huffman said he looks for authenticity in a child's statement in a number of ways, including having knowledge beyond their age. What authorities are listening for are \"things from the child that they should have no knowledge of because of their age. Those are red flags,\" Oswalt said. Consistency also can be checked by reviewing the story with the child and inserting something they didn't say to see if the child corrects them, Huffman said. Defense attorney Kristin Burkett, who represented the exonerated defendants in both unsuccessful prosecutions, grilled police on the lack of an accompanying video or audio tape with their interview notes. Time and again, she asked detectives and jurors how anyone could critique whether the interviews were conducted properly or if stark differences existed in the victim's account if there was no digital or analog record. One juror, who spoke to The Advocate after finding a defendant not guilty, said the lack of a recording and the definitive proof it would have contained influenced his decision. Burkett called it a \"huge problem\" Wednesday in an interview with The Advocate. \"I haven't spoke to an expert that doesn't believe those interviews should be taped,\" she said. \"If they are doing their job properly, there is no reason why they wouldn't want to tape it.\" Huffman said he personally favors taping, but the county has a policy against recording victim statements in child sexual abuse cases. Oswalt said what happens before and after the tape is switched off still will be open to scrutiny by defense attorneys. He added it was \"dead wrong\" to assume a recording would eliminate that same line of questioning. \"At the end of the day, you still need to trust the experience and integrity of the social workers and officers doing the case,\" Oswalt said. Burkett agreed with Oswalt that making a child testify in court is not the ideal outcome for the child. As a defense attorney, Burkett has to find a balance of aggressiveness and tact when questioning young witnesses. She said it's not like questioning an adult witness for the state. \"I don't want to do anything I don't have to when a child is on the stand, but I still have to represent my client,\" she said. Burkett described Licking County as generally a \"non-plea-bargaining jurisdiction\" but said these type of cases are the exception. Judges are more amenable to a reduced charge or disclosing their sentence in order to facilitate a plea, she said. There's little debate about the social stigma attached to sex offenses committed against children, and Burkett said even a not-guilty finding can't erase public perception of a defendant. \"People's lives are changed by the mere allegation of child sex abuse, and it doesn't go away,\" she said, \"which is why I believe these cases should be investigated more thoroughly than any other case.\" The children, win or lose in court, can bounce back with a strong support system, Weiner said. \"Kids are resilient, and with love and support they make it,\" he said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "NEWARK", "latitude": 40.0581, "longitude": -82.4013}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}, {"name": "Newark", "latitude": 40.0581, "longitude": -82.4013}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

BY CHAD KLIMACK Advocate Reporter March 29, 2009 PATASKALA -- City officials say it might not be that difficult to redevelop a burned-out block downtown. Some officials initially thought it would take a zoning variance to rebuild two gutted buildings, but that might not be the case. \"It would appear somebody will be able to build a pretty substantial building there without going through a variance at all,\" said Diane Harris, the city's planning and zoning director. A March 7 fire, which investigators have labeled an arson, gutted most of a block on the west side of South Main Street, just south of the railroad tracks. Demolition crews subsequently tore down both 341 and 345 S. Main St. One of the buildings contained a heating and cooling businesses and the other was vacant. Mayor Steve Butcher initially thought the city's zoning would make it difficult for the current property owners -- or future ones -- to rebuild. However, he said that does not appear to be the case because the city's Downtown Business zoning designation permits developers to build something similar to what once stood there. In fact, the zoning would permit one of the property owners to build a three-story building containing up to 24,750 square feet. It would allow the other one to build a three-story building with up to 3,000 square feet. One of the property owners, Fred Ashbaugh, has said he intends to take his time in deciding whether to rebuild. He said he needs to take into account the lack of parking downtown and modern safety codes, in addition to the city's zoning. The other property owner, Claude Williams, could not be reached for comment. City officials have spoken to both property owners, and Butcher said Williams might not want to rebuild. \"We don't have any knowledge Mr. Williams is looking to develop his property, but we sure hope someone is,\" Butcher said. Harris, meanwhile, said the city would be willing to help someone find grants to rebuild. \"From my own perspective, I would like to see something that is respectful of the past,\" said Harris, adding she also would like to see someone build something that meshes with the rest of downtown. Butcher, meanwhile, said he would not be surprised if it takes both property owners time to decide how to proceed. A fire gutted he and his wife Nancy's restaurant, Nutcracker Family Restaurant, in 2005, and although the couple decided to reopen, the decision was not easy, he said. \"We went through the same struggle,\" Butcher said. \"Do we rebuild or do we take the (insurance) money?\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Pataskala", "latitude": 39.9956, "longitude": -82.6743}, {"name": "PATASKALA", "latitude": 39.9956, "longitude": -82.6743}, {"name": "South Main Street", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "S.

BY ABBEY ROY Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK -- After spending a year on the other side of the equator, practicing at a rural New Zealand hospital with a total of nine beds, Jackie Underwood is thrilled to return home to Licking Memorial Hospital. \"It makes you appreciate here,\" Underwood said. \"It makes you appreciate the United States' private medicine.\" Underwood, a family practitioner at Licking Memorial from 1982-2006 and afterward in New Hampshire and Minnesota, left in January 2007 to practice in New Zealand after researching a brochure she'd received in the mail about the country. The experience was one she is grateful for, and she hopes to return to New Zealand as a tourist someday to explore the parts of it she missed this time around. Still, certain things New Zealand's culture took some getting used to, she said -- primarily, the country's national health care system. \"People have to wait a long time for things,\" Underwood said, citing examples such as tests or referrals. \"Things we take for granted here aren't taken for granted there.\" In New Zealand, she was one of six \"GPs\" -- general practitioners -- at the Queen Street Practice. The people in the town where she worked, Wairoa, were very friendly and mostly Maori, an indigenous group similar in culture, history and language to American Indians, Underwood said. Although the town was \"very blue-collar,\" she said, the citizens were kind and appreciated the care they received -- even if it was just a bit at a time. \"With the national health care ... people came in for one problem and one problem only,\" Underwood said. Additional maladies were required to be scheduled for different appointments. Although she had only 10 vacation days during her time in New Zealand, Underwood was able to accomplish a goal she had set for herself: scuba diving off the coast. When she returns as a tourist, she also hopes to tour the northernmost point of the country's North Island and the southernmost point of South Island, she said. In the meantime, she's content to be back at Licking Memorial, practicing with her old partner and enjoying facilities she said are better than any she's worked at. \"We have really good quality here,\" she said. \"There's a big focus here on quality.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Newark", "latitude": 40.0581, "longitude": -82.4013}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "NEWARK", "latitude": 40.0581, "longitude": -82.4013}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "New Hampshire", "latitude": 43.667, "longitude": -71.4998}, {"name": "Minnesota", "latitude": 46.2502, "longitude": -94.2506}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "Wairoa", "latitude": -39.0333, "longitude": 177.367}, {"name": "Maori", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "North Island", "latitude": -39.0, "longitude": 176.0}, {"name": "South Island", "latitude": -43.0, "longitude": 171.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

BY KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK -- The recent reported surge in home sales nationally has not yet reached Licking County, according to Licking County property transfer records provided by the county. The number of sales through March 15 dropped from 493 in 2008 to 309 this year, a 37 percent decline. The average sale price fell from $122,492 in 2008 to $110,416 so far in 2009, an almost 10 percent decrease. Jackie Lewis, president of the Licking County Board of Realtors, said she has seen signs better times are ahead, but buyers remain cautious. \"I can truly say people are out looking, but they're still hesitant to make up their minds because so many homes are sitting bank-owned,\" Lewis said. \"In warmer weather, people start to look.\" The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes increased 5.1 percent in February compared to January, the largest monthly sales jump since July 2003. But local sales were virtually unchanged from January to February, according to the local board of Realtors. In the three Licking County cities of Newark, Heath and Pataskala, the sales through March 15 dropped from a combined 251 last year to 155 this year, a 38 percent tumble. Lewis predicts a surge not only because residents traditionally look more seriously in the spring, but also because of investors facing a tax deadline. They want to buy, Lewis said, because they have money they don't want taxed. The Licking County Board of Realtors reports home sales through its Multiple Listing Service fell during the first two months of the year, from 151 in 2008 to 114 this year, a 25 percent decline. Prices also dropped by 11 percent. Still, she thinks the deals are just too good for people to pass up much longer, and the increased sales elsewhere will begin to show up here. \"We see this in anything,\" Lewis said. \"It always hits the West Coast first and comes our way. Why? I have no idea. It's all about educating our buyers.\" Nathan Gill, a mortgage banker with American Eagle Mortgage Corp., said he has fielded an increase in phone calls requesting loan applications, mostly from first-time homebuyers. The reason for the increased interest, he said, probably is the federal tax credit available through Nov. 30. The refundable tax credit, on 2009 taxes filed in 2010, is for 10 percent of the sale price up to $8,000. \"I think the word is finally getting out,\" Gill said. \"We're trying to let people know there are advantages to purchasing homes right now. \"The tax credit, I believe, will have an effect this year. People have got to take advantage of it now.\" The Ohio Housing Finance Agency's Homebuyer Tax Credit Advantage Program, which starts March 30, allows homebuyers to use up to 3 percent of the purchase price for the down payment. They don't have to pay the loan back until July 1, 2010, he said Interest rates, Gill said, were available Friday at about 4.75 percent, compared to 8 percent in 2000, when homes were selling in large numbers.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "NEWARK", "latitude": 40.0581, "longitude": -82.4013}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}, {"name": "Newark", "latitude": 40.0581, "longitude": -82.4013}, {"name": "Heath", "latitude": 40.0228, "longitude": -82.4446}, {"name": "Pataskala", "latitude": 39.9956, "longitude": -82.6743}, {"name": "Licking County", "latitude": 40.0834, "longitude": -82.5002}, {"name": "West Coast", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

BY L.B. WHYDE Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 HANOVER -- The Licking Valley students in library media specialist Tracy Boehmer's E-Research class sat around the table with laptops and a volunteer from the Licking County Genealogy Society by their side. The room was hushed as eyes scanned the countless screens of information the students were scouring to find out more about their own family histories. Suddenly, there was a shout of success as Blake Holdsworth, 18, and her volunteer helper, Terry Cooperrider, discovered Holdsworth's many times-great-uncle with documents from 1355. Holdsworth was told by her grandfather, who is a poet, that she is related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a popular American poet of the 19th century, whose famous phrases include \"ships that pass in the night\" and \"the patter of little feet.\" But this discovery confirmed she is related to the poet. \"I think it's really neat,\" Holdsworth said. \"I wanted to know exactly how I was related to him.\" The project is a collaboration between Boehmer and Raynola St. Clair, of the Licking County Genealogy Society. St. Clair wants to get the word out about the importance of knowing family history and the ways to research. The daylong session was open to all students interested in learning more about their ancestors. \"It's important to know how to research on line and what resources are available,\" Boehmer said. \"I am finding a lot is available from the Licking County Public Library. The LC Genealogical Society volunteers couldn't be more helpful.\" Lindsey Evans, 17, a senior, was digging into her family history and found documentation from a ship's passenger list that an ancestor came to this country from Germany in 1852. Senior Carrie Lough, 18, was working with St. Clair and trying to locate her great-great grandfather. Her father had just told her about him, saying he had fought in World War I. It wasn't long before St. Clair could verify that Hugh Jacobson did indeed fight in the war. \"It's really interesting. I never thought about genealogy before,\" Lough said. St. Clair is on a mission to spread the word about importance of family genealogy by giving seminars in the school, churches and one-on-one. Licking Valley High School is conducting another session next year. \"I especially want to get kids involved because they are the ones that will carry this on,\" St. Clair said.

By KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK \u0097 Wess Henry, who lost his home to foreclosure last year, was fishing for a way to change his luck. He hopes his fortunes change after he opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop on Friday the 13th of March. Henry and his son, Matt, are co-owners of the business at 197 N. Cedar St.Henry purchased the inventory of Newark Live Bait, which closed its Western Avenue business in January. He then found the rent at the Cedar Street location was affordable. The unlikely chain of events started when Matt Henry started planning for a fishing trip a few months ago. \u201cI called down there (to Newark Live Bait) to see what they wanted for bait and she said, \u0091I\u2019ll give you what I got because I\u2019m going out of business,\u2019\u201d Matt Henry said. \u201cAnd, she gave me a price for everything in the store. It was an offer we couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d The Henrys had talked about opening a bait shop, but the did not know that Newark Live Bait was going out of business until his son stumbled onto the news. \u201cI\u2019d say it was fisherman\u2019s luck,\u201d Wess Henry said. \u201cEverything seemed to fall into place, If (Matt) hadn\u2019t decided to go fishing, it probably wouldn\u2019t be reality. I still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here.\u201d Wess Henry, 47, a 14-year employee of Tectum Inc., had just enough savings to start the business without a loan, which he said he probably could not have secured anyway. The Henrys said they have a good chance of developing a successful business once people discover them and their location because there is not much competition. \u201cThe fishermen are spreading the word amongst themselves,\u201d Wess Henry said. \u201cEveryone is so glad we\u2019re here because there\u2019s nowhere else to get bait. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to listen to what customers want. If people want something, I\u2019ll try to get it in within a week from the bait dealer.\u201d Wess Henry does have some retail experience. His parents had operated what Wess said was the largest bicycle shop in Licking County in the 1980s, Mound City Bicycle Shop on Idlewilde Avenue. The shop will continue the tradition from Newark Live Bait of providing fishing contests and offering a raffle and door prizes. Wess Henry also dabbles in woodworking and sells some of his work at the shop. The recession could actually work in the Henrys\u2019 favor in a couple ways, Matt said. \u201cIt may even spike when the economy is down because, when people are laid off, there is nothing else to do, and they may as well go fishing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s about the cheapest hobby left.\u201d Although fishermen can spend large amounts of money for equipment and boats, the Henrys said they also can get started with a license and minimal equipment for about $50. Another potential benefit from the poor economy is stimulus money offered from the government. Matt Henry applied for $100,000 to hire employees, purchase more inventory and even open up a second store. \u201cI said, just for the heck of it, apply for it,\u201d Wess said he told his son. Matt Henry, 24, said he\u2019s counting on the business lasting well into the future. \u201cI hope it\u2019s here for the next 40 years,\u201d Matt Henry said. \u201cEssentially, this is what I want to make my life\u2019s work.\u201d Matt Henry, left, and his father, Wess Henry, opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop at 197 N.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan agreed Monday to reinstate a fired chief justice, a move that will help defuse a political crisis that has sparked street battles and raised fears of instability in the country at a time of surging Islamist violence. Opposition leaders and lawyers had vowed to sit-in at the parliament later Monday until Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, known for his independence and willingness to challenge authority, was reinstated. The capital has been barricaded and scores of extra police brought in amid fears of violence. In a dawn address to the nation that capped a night of high drama, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced Chaudhry would be sworn in on March 21, the day the current chief justice was due to retire. The speech triggered scenes of jubilation outside Chaudhry's home in the capital, Islamabad. Gilani also ordered all lawyers and political activists arrested over the past week to be freed immediately. The concession came as thousands of protesters led by Nawaz Sharif, the head of the largest opposition party and a longtime foe of President Asif Ali Zardari, were traveling to Islamabad to join the planned sit-in. Sharif joined the convoy after ignoring a house arrest order in his hometown of Lahore in Punjab, where his supporters fought running battles with police. \"This is a victory for the people of this country,\" said Baz Mohammad Kakar, a leader of the lawyers' movement. \"Chaudhry is the first chief justice in the history of Pakistan who has proved himself to be a judge for the people, as a chief justice for the people.\" Former President Pervez Musharraf fired Chaudhry, 60, in 2007 after he took up cases challenging the leader's rule, sparking a wave of protests that helped force Musharraf from power in 2008. Musharraf's successor, Zardari, pledged to reinstate Chaudhry within 30 days of taking office, but reneged on the promise, apparently fearing the justice might examine a deal that he and his wife, slain politician Benazir Bhutto, struck with Musharraf to grant the pair immunity from prosecution over alleged corruption cases.

The roots of last year's unprecedented decision to close the California coast to salmon fishing took hold three years earlier, in the spring of 2005 when juvenile fish swam through the Golden Gate to an ocean lacking ample food for them, a new report says. On the Farallon Islands bird sanctuary, nearly all the Cassin's auklets, which eat the same kind of food as juvenile salmon, abandoned their nests that year. Gray whales that migrate along the coast were reported emaciated and sea lions were found searching for food far from shore. The salmon that would have returned to spawn in 2007 starved, or were weakened and eaten by other fish or birds. The same thing happened in 2006, causing low numbers to return again last year. Naturally varying ocean conditions were the immediate cause of a fishing season closure for which $170 million in federal disaster funds were made available last year, according to a report released Wednesday by a team of scientists assigned last year to investigate the collapse. But if ocean conditions have always varied, why did the salmon numbers fall so precipitously? The scientists who wrote the report contend that while ocean conditions were bad, California's salmon have been so weakened by loss of habitat, water diversions and reliance on hatcheries that they were especially vulnerable. The report focused on the cause of the commercially valuable workhorse of California's salmon fishery \u2014 the Sacramento River fall run of chinook salmon. Those fish may have produced as many as 900,000 spawners in years past, but in 2007 just 88,000 fish returned. Last year was even lower, and regulators expect just 122,000 spawners this fall. The National Marine Fisheries Service, meanwhile, has concluded that state water operations are threatening other salmon runs, steelhead, green sturgeon and the Puget Sound population of salmon-eating orcas \u2014 even to the point of extinction. That agency is expected to develop new restrictions on water managers by June. But for the fall run, the biggest problems have been ocean conditions and a heavy reliance on hatcheries to produce fish \u2014 hatcheries that are meant to make up for the loss of spawning habitat that is blocked by dams. In particular, California's rivers and streams produced so few wild salmon that as much as 90 percent of the state's salmon, according to one recent study, have evolved in hatcheries. The lack of genetic diversity leaves salmon as vulnerable to ups and downs as an investor without a diversified portfolio. \"The system we have of having everything the same, we can expect less variation, and we can expect more booms and busts,\" said Churchill Grimes, director of a federal fisheries science laboratory in Santa Cruz and co-leader of the study. \"You don't have any hedging.\" In the past, if food was scarce in the spring there might still be a lot of juvenile salmon swimming under the Golden Gate later in the spring when the food might be available. But not so in recent years. The lack of food off the coast in the spring of 2005 and 2006 was caused by the weak upwelling \u2014 where nutrient-rich waters off the coast rise toward the surface and, in a good year, cause an explosion of marine life that is especially apparent in places like the Farallon Islands. The head of a major commercial fishing association said the report was on the right track but too heavily focused on ocean problems, for which little can be done. \"They got it about half-right,\" said Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. \"We've got to be able to get these fish down the rivers, through the Delta to the ocean. These are things they have avoided in the past because they're controversial.\" Grader contends that dams, pumps and water management policies are to blame for the collapse. Ocean conditions have improved in recent years and that, combined with new restrictions on water pumping out of the Delta, could help fuel a recovery next year, Grader said. It's virtually assured that regulators will close the California coastal salmon fishing season to commercial anglers again this year.

UNION CITY \u2014 Hoping to avert further erosion of district services because of state budget cuts, the New Haven school board has hired consultants to determine the likelihood that voters would support a parcel tax to fund school programs. But board members are split over whether to ask voters for money when families increasingly are strapped for cash. One trustee, who supported further consideration of a tax, implied that the timing is not ideal. Just last November, voters agreed to tax themselves $3.2 million annually for eight years to pay for public-safety services. Nevertheless, school board President Gertrude Gregorio said, \"We cannot wait for Sacramento to give us adequate funding. ... I know this is not the best time to ask our community for more money, but ... if the budget continues the way it is, there's no way we can afford to give our children (what we want). It's an expensive proposition, but it's needed.\" In a 3-2 vote, with trustees Michelle Matthews and Gwen Estes dissenting, the board on Tuesday approved hiring two consulting groups for a maximum of $54,500 to conduct initial assessments to determine voter interest in a tax. Any decision to place a tax measure on a ballot would require another board vote. At this point, Superintendent Kari McVeigh said, \"What we're really trying to find out is, 'Will this community support any parcel tax, and if so, under what terms and how much?'\" \" Another firm, Hahn and Associates, will act as political consultants and help craft messages to the public about the need for a tax. Last spring, the school board slashed $7 million. This year, it's made $4 million in budgetary adjustments through cuts and borrowing money from itself, and has approved $5.9 million more in cuts from the 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets. With the reductions, the district plans to increase class sizes, stop offering co-curricular activities, eliminate its busing program and possibly close an elementary school in the next two years. New Haven is not the only district to consider turning to voters for additional revenue. The Fremont school board recently directed its superintendent to meet with consultants to discuss a similar parcel tax and is scheduled to receive an update next week.

Bay Area lawmakers continue to resurrect bills that died in previous Congresses, hoping that having a wider margin of majority in the House and a Democrat in the White House could bring the bills success this time around. For example, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, and U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., today reintroduced their Responsible Education About Life, or REAL, Act, which would authorize federal funding for comprehensive, age-appropriate, medically accurate sex education. For now, such funding is available only for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, which have been shown to exclude important information about contraception as a protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. \"It's time for us to get REAL about sex education,\" Lee said in her news release. \"We should absolutely be teaching young people about abstinence, but we shouldn't be holding back information that can save lives and prevent unwanted pregnancies. Instead of 'abstinence only,' what we're proposing is 'abstinence-plus.' \" Elsewhere, Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, today introduced H.R.1546, the Caring for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2009. The bill would establish a special panel within the Department of Veterans Affairs to assess the department's capacity to treat veterans who have traumatic brain injuries as well as to make recommendations on developing policies for care and rehabilitation. It also would help establish TBI-specific education and training programs for VA's health professionals. \"Many of our soldiers who have been wounded in Iraq have experienced a traumatic brain injury. In fact, traumatic brain injuries are the hallmark injuries of this war,\" McNerney said in his news release. \"It is incumbent on us to ensure that the (Department of Veterans Affairs) is equipped and ready to provide the ongoing services necessary to fully address the impact of traumatic brain injuries.\" McNerney had introduced a similar bill in May 2007, but that bill never emerged from committee. Tom Del Beccaro of Lafayette, vice chairman of the California Republican Party, today is helping to launch a new political action committee, called the \"First Amendment Now Campaign.\" The PAC is intended to combat what Del Beccaro says are Democratic efforts to curtail conservative political speech. The main issue is the Fairness Doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission policy dating from 1949 but abolished in 1987 that required broadcast license holders to present controversial issues of public importance in a way the FCC considered honest, equitable and balanced. Although President Barack Obama repeatedly has said he opposes reinstating it and the U.S. Senate last month overwhelmingly approved an amendment nixing it, conservatives have continued to rally against it, leading some critics to wonder whether it's an intentional effort to dangle some red meat as a distraction from other issues. Still, Del Beccaro, California Political News and Views publisher Steve Frank and state Sen. Tony Strickland, R-Moorpark, along with a bunch of conservative talk-radio personalities, are launching this new organization, asking for donations of $17.76 \"to preserve our freedom.\" Besides the Fairness Doctrine, they say, they're concerned about Obama's calls for \"localism,\" or requiring broadcast license holders to dedicate some of their airtime to the interests of their local community \u2014 obviously a concern for a conservative station such as KSFO-AM/560 that's located in an overwhelmingly liberal media market such as the Bay Area. And they're also worried about Obama's calls for broadcast media ownership diversity, dating to 2007 and echoed now in Congress. The president and supporters claim they're concerned about a lack of female and minority ownership in the broadcast media, but opponents claim it's just another backdoor way to undercut conservative free speech. So, expect to hear a lot about this all across your AM radio dial as this new organization holds a kickoff rally Tuesday in Sacramento, on the Capitol's north steps, and as it moves forward with an effort to gather a million petition signatures that it can present to U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both of California.

Marlene Uhing, superintendent of schools, organized the meeting at the district's central office administration building. Sunny Meadow's part-time principal Chad Boyer and several other administrators were present, as well as three school board members - Brad Krivohlavek, Clark Froehlich and Alfredo Ramirez. The focus of the meeting was a recent administration announcement that the school is being recommended for closure. The recommendation came during a Sunny Meadow Parent Teacher Organization meeting on March 10 - one day after the board of education heard recommendations from the Shaping the Future committee regarding instructional issues. The committee - made up of administrators, staff and parents of students - recommended a district-wide grade configuration, consolidation of some programs and the relocation of certain programs, including the Montessori, Early Childhood and the alternative school. The Montessori program has been considered by the administrative team to move into the Sunny Meadow building with existing Sunny Meadow students dispersed into other elementary schools in Norfolk. Uhing provided information and some background details on the Shaping the Future and administrative team recommendations, as well as to address concerns regarding the committee. \"Not every (school) building was represented\" on the committee, Uhing said. \"We had people volunteer, we had people nominated by staff members, we had principals make recommendations for that. It was pretty much open to everyone who volunteered to get involved. \"Uhing stressed that the committee did what it was asked to do - review information gathered from several sources, including community forums, and to make recommendations to the board of education. \"They did what they were asked to do and they did a nice job of it.

She said it is the job of the administration and the board of education to consider the overall needs of the district and to think locally but act globally. \"What's most important? Are buildings going to be more important to us than keeping people and keeping programs? . . . My personal feeling is, and the administration team recommendation is, that if we can keep people and programs, that's what we're going to try and do,\" Uhing said. She also addressed the Montessori program and reiterated the fact that it is a public - not a private - program within the district. Uhing also mentioned that it has been a part of the district for longer than Sunny Meadow, which was absorbed by the district when Class I elementary-only schools were required to be absorbed by K-12 districts following the passage of LB126. The focus of Monday's meeting, Uhing said, was to hear the public concerns and questions, not to address directly them at that point. She said all of the information shared Monday night would be taken to the entire board of education for discussion and consideration.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Norfolk", "latitude": 42.0283, "longitude": -97.417}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

A SPATE of vandalised 4x4 vehicles has sparked fears an eco-fanatic is targeting \u201cgas guzzling\u201d cars in Oxford. Builder Phillip Bradley has seen his new \u00a325,000 Isuzu attacked outside his home in Osney Island four times, leaving him with a \u00a31,700 repair bill. Over the past fortnight his vehicle has been vandalised twice. Another 4x4 owner nearby has also had his windscreen of his Toyota Hilux repeatedly smashed since January. People in Osney Island have been shocked by the level of car vandalism in recent weeks, with the damage always happening at weekends in the early hours of the morning. But residents are now convinced the vandalism is not random, as 4x4s are suffering the brunt of the attacks. One owner on Osney Island has now taken to sleeping in his vehicle at night in the hope of catching his tormentor. And he has also had CCTV cameras put in front of his house. Mr Bradley said his Isuzu Denver Rodeo was first damaged just two days after he bought it in October, when the windscreen was smashed. The car had been parked outside his home in West Street. The latest attack happened on Friday night when the windscreen was again smashed and the bonnet pierced \u2014 apparently with a heavy metal spike. Mr Bradley, a father-of-two who owns the building firm Attics +, said he was disturbed at 4am by a loud smashing noise. He had been sleeping in the front bedroom of his house to keep watch over his vehicle. But the offender had fled down Swan Street by the time he had rushed to his car. Mr Bradley said: \u201cI had thought I was the victim of some personal vendetta when if first happened. But then I heard about another guy in East Street having his 4x4 damaged. I don\u2019t believe we are talking about youngsters who have been to the clubs, or the hooded crew. This seems to be someone who is on a mission. \u201cIt is someone who is going to keep on coming back until he is caught. \u201cMy guess is that it\u2019s someone who perceives cars like mine to be a \u2018gas guzzler\u2019. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. It actually takes diesel. I bought it because it\u2019s a nice car for the family and I can also use it at work. The owner of the vandalised Toyota Hilux is Ian Beesley, also a builder, who lives on Ferry Hinksey Road. Mr Beesley, widely known as Digger, said his car had been parked on only yards from his home when it was vandalised. He also feared a misguided ecologically-minded fanatic was the most likely culprit.

SCHOOLCHILDREN in Oxford have been putting forward business ideas before a panel of \u201cBusiness Angels\u201d in the city\u2019s own version of hit television programme Dragon\u2019s Den. Pupils from three city schools gave pitches to a panel of Angels under the new Business X scheme \u2014 all for a share of \u00a330,000. Pupils at Matthew Arnold School, in Botley, St Gregory the Great School in East Oxford and Magdalen College School, Cowley Place, have been working on their proposals for months with the help of MBA students from the Said Business School. After several hours, the panel of venture capitalists, businessmen and women and entrepreneurs, agreed to invest in two of the schemes, pending further information. St Gregory the Great School\u2019s team, which was seeking funds to develop a community allotment, got the backing of the panel. They asked for \u00a34,800 and have been told they will get financial backing, though the final figure has not yet been agreed. Team member Vaughan Matthews, 17, from Cowley, said: \u201cIt was a great experience. It was very difficult. Most of us have seen Dragon\u2019s Den and you can criticise the show, but until you\u2019re in that position, you can\u2019t describe what it\u2019s like.\u201d Philip Blackwell, from the Blackwell family behind the famous Broad Street bookshop, told the group: \u201cWe loved it and we thought you were enthusiastic, ambitious, and your scheme had great environmental and social benefits.\u201d The Angels decided against investing in Matthew Arnold School\u2019s specialist puzzle cube, but were so impressed by the way the group worked together, they offered to work with them to find a different product. They had asked for \u00a315,000 for a laser cutter to create the cube, aimed at the disabled market. Adam Newport, 14, from Botley, said: \u201cWe have all put a lot of work in this, all of us have pulled our weight and it has been interesting.\u201d Two different groups from Magdalen College School took part in the contest, with business ideas for a yearbook company and for an environmental social networking site. The panel decided to invest in the first scheme, but not in the second. Ely Sandler, from the yearbook project called Form, said: \u201cWe have put a lot of effort into this and Business X has been very helpful. \u201cIt is a really good idea and it\u2019s a great way to get us started.\u201d The different groups will report back to the Business Angels on July 1.

A TEENAGER who is fighting leukaemia has joined a slimming club after being told by doctors to lose weight. Matthew Holder-Wooloff, 15, from Bicester, was introduced to Slimming World classes by his mother just over a year ago, after his treatment for leukaemia caused him to pile on over two stone. The steroids that doctors prescribed for Matthew, a student at The Cooper School in Bicester, after he was diagnosed with the blood and bone marrow cancer also reduced his bone density, so the young rugby fan found he was too weak to play his favourite sport. Matthew\u2019s mother, Jackie, said: \u201cMatthew was diagnosed in 2007. We thought he had come down with a really bad cold and cough and couldn\u2019t seem to shake it off, so we took him to the doctors. \u201cAs part of the treatment he was given steroids and one of the side effects is a huge appetite.\u201d Matthew, who is 5ft 8ins tall, saw his weight jump from about 12 stone to 14 stone. Mrs Holder-Wooloff said: \u201cI decided to take Matthew to Slimming World because I\u2019d seen how well it worked for other members of my family. \u201cWe ran it past the hospital and they were very happy with the idea. \u201cMy sister\u2019s family lost about 17 stone between four of them there, so we knew it worked. \u201cWhen he was in hospital I found I gained a lot of weight too because I was spending all of my time with him and living on food from the cafe, so I went with him.\u201d In the year Mrs Holder-Wooloff and her son have been members, she has lost two stone and Matthew has shed a stone and half. According to Slimming World, its members lose weight through a combination of a healthy diet, moderate exercise, and group support sessions where members are encouraged to shun bad eating habits. The sessions cost \u00a34.50 a week, but children between 11 and 15 can join for free if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. Although it will be another 14 months before Matthew can be given the all-clear from the disease, he and his mother intend to carry on with the weekly sessions at Southwold School, in Holm Way, Bicester.

The \u2018swishing\u2019 event, at Baby Simple bar in Cowley Road on Saturday, was held in aid of pioneering East Oxford children\u2019s hospice Helen & Douglas House. Dozens of women of all ages brought in clothes they no longer wanted and exchanged them for new items. They each paid a \u00a35 fee to take part in the event, with all proceeds going to the Magdalen Road hospice. Helen Cordiner, a fundraising assistant at the hospice, said: \u201cPeople were really generous and the feedback was that they all spotted something they liked.\u201d Doors opened an hour before the \u2018swish\u2019 began, giving participants a chance to hand over clothes, bags, shoes, accessories and jewellery, and check out what other people had to offer. There was no fighting in the aisles but high-fives were exchanged as the fashionistas managed to get their hands on coveted items of clothing. She said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant idea \u2014 I had never heard of swishing before this.\u201d Anna Winstanley, 25, from Marston, brought several coats that didn\u2019t fit or that she had bought on a whim. She successfully swished them for a dress and skirt she spotted early on. Ms Winstanley said: \u201cI came with a few friends and we had spies around the room who knew what we wanted. \u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant idea, especially in the current economic climate, and Helen & Douglas House is a brilliant cause.\u201d Fiona Evans, 27, who works at the hospice organising activity events, said: \u201cI brought a bag with about 20 things in it and me and my friend actually swished before we got here between the two of us. Miss Cordiner said she hoped Saturday\u2019s fundraiser, which attracted about 30 people, would be the first of many similar events. She also called on people to organise their own swishing sessions among friends, where they could charge a small fee to go towards the hospice. CLOTHES swapping parties first started in America several years ago but have started coming into their own in the UK in the last two years. Swishes are often arranged by ethical charities, with the idea being that clothes swapping stops good quality clothes being thrown away, and means people can update their wardrobes for free. Celebrities such as Kylie, Naomi Campbell and Kelly Osbourne have handed over their own clothes for swishing parties, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Lindsay Lohan are said to be confirmed fans.

HAMILTON \u2014 Staring down the barrel of a potential $500,000 assessment for back taxes, Butler County Auditor Roger Reynolds said the county is drafting policies to make sure employees pay taxes on fringe benefits in the future. It's unclear why the county wasn't paying these taxes. Former deputy auditor Randy Groves said in 2007 county officials were unaware these items were taxable until shortly before an ongoing Internal Revenue Service audit began that year. That audit is wrapping up now, and is finding that county employees should have paid taxes on roughly $1.5 million for perks such as use of county cars, cell phones and uniforms. Since the county didn't report those perks as income, that bill may soon go to the county. While county leaders agree the county will comply, some also question the wisdom of the tax code. For example, the IRS wants to tax employees who are given county cell phones because they could use them off the clock. But county policy prohibits employees from using cell phones for personal use. \"Why is the telephone on my desk any different from my cell phone?\" said Commissioner Gregory Jolivette, who called the IRS rule \"crazy.\" The IRS wants to tax the county for roughly $580,000 spent on employee cell phones, roughly $720,000 spent on uniforms and roughly $250,000 for vehicles employees take home. This includes parts of uniforms worn by sheriff's deputies, such as T-shirts and certain pants that could conceivably be worn mowing the lawn at home. But a deputy would be fired for doing so, according to Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Anthony Dwyer. In addition to deputies, Jolivette said it's vital that utility workers and others in the public have uniforms that clearly identify them as county employees. \"Is that worker, when not in the field, supposed to go back to the office and change into a shirt that they own to go out to lunch?\" Jolivette said. \"It doesn't make sense.\" Other fringe benefits the IRS wants to tax are tuition reimbursement, travel allowances and parking passes. Reynolds said the original assessment against the county was higher than $500,000 and could go down further as he works with a tax attorney in negotiations with the IRS. \"We are currently working on reducing the outstanding amount,\" he said. But he's not looking for a fight with the tax man. \"The IRS has its rules,\" he said. \"It's not for me to decide what those rules are, it's up to me to adhere to those rules as put forward by the IRS and I'll do that to the best of my ability.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Butler County", "latitude": 39.4501, "longitude": -84.5666}, {"name": "HAMILTON", "latitude": 39.3995, "longitude": -84.5613}, {"name": "Butler County", "latitude": 39.4501, "longitude": -84.5666}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

By emphasizing plans to extend Ohio 63 west as a potential multi-modal project, county officials hope federal funding will become more likely. The Butler County Transportation Improvement District has passed a resolution to designate Ohio 63 as a multi-modal project. The project has the potential of opening up new transportation routes through Monroe, Trenton and Seven Mile. It also has the possibility of connecting the county to major routes such as Interstates 75 and 70 and U.S. 127, as well as rail, said Ron Porter, TID director. With so much emphasis at the federal level for incorporating multiple systems of transportation into projects, the prioritization could help obtain federal funding, said Bill Triick, TID board member and president of the Chamber of Commerce Serving Middletown, Trenton and Monroe. The business community has been overwhelming in support of the project due to the lower transportation costs it would afford them by offering a more direct route, Triick said. \"That highway was never supposed to stop at Route 4. There is no major commercialization in the northern part of the county and that is due to lack of infrastructure,\" he said. The extension has been a priority for the county for many years, but has had issues obtaining funding. The TID submitted the project, estimated to cost $138.2 million, to the Ohio Department of Development for potential federal stimulus funding. The funding is still a major concern for the city of Monroe, which has yet to pass a resolution supporting the extension as requested by the TID. The roadway would reach five miles into the city, according to county engineer Greg Wilkens. \"The biggest concern is who is going to maintain that bridge across the river,\" said Monroe Mayor Robert Routson. \"It could potentially be St. Clair Twp., Madison Twp., Trenton or Monroe. Someone has got to assume responsibility to maintain that bridge.\" While Routson said he would support the project, he indicated the project would be more beneficial to the county and Trenton than Monroe.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Butler County", "latitude": 39.4501, "longitude": -84.5666}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Monroe", "latitude": 39.4403, "longitude": -84.3622}, {"name": "Trenton", "latitude": 39.4809, "longitude": -84.4577}, {"name": "Seven Mile", "latitude": 39.4801, "longitude": -84.5519}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Middletown", "latitude": 39.5151, "longitude": -84.3983}, {"name": "Trenton", "latitude": 39.4809, "longitude": -84.4577}, {"name": "Monroe", "latitude": 39.4403, "longitude": -84.3622}, {"name": "Ohio", "latitude": 40.2503, "longitude": -83.0002}, {"name": "Monroe", "latitude": 39.4403, "longitude": -84.3622}, {"name": "Monroe", "latitude": 39.4403, "longitude": -84.3622}, {"name": "St. Clair Twp.", "latitude": 39.4351, "longitude": -84.5466}, {"name": "Madison Twp.", "latitude": 39.5384, "longitude": -84.4152}, {"name": "Trenton", "latitude": 39.4809, "longitude": -84.4577}, {"name": "Monroe", "latitude": 39.4403, "longitude": -84.3622}, {"name": "Trenton", "latitude": 39.4809, "longitude": -84.4577}, {"name": "Monroe", "latitude": 39.4403, "longitude": -84.3622}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Mayor Michael Harding reminded a chamber of commerce audience Thursday morning not to let its fear of the world's economy become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Harding, speaking to the annual Woodstock District Chamber of Commerce Mayor's Breakfast at the Quality Hotel and Suites, parlayed a few anecdotes of looking fear in the face into one of the themes he touched on during his 45-minute presentation. At first referring to a first time skippering a sailboat on Lake Ontario in rough waters, the mayor told and then returned to an experience piloting a glider. Putting the aircraft into a downward spiral, the craft fell 10 storeys before his instructor yelled over his shoulder 'hard left rudder.' \"Just as quickly, the plane corrected itself, because it wants to fly,\" Harding said, repeating the line with a slight change to end his address. \"If we behave totally out of fear, our situation will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Every one of you is tightening your belts, but just like the glider... the plane wants to fly.\" He used these two anecdotes as examples of looking fear in the face and confronting it, extending his point that Woodstock is faring better than others within what's happening in the world economy. Showing slides of panic-driven media coverage of past economic slowdowns -- some of which never materialized -- Harding pointed out how media often fuel the fires of fear. A fear through which one should keep a steady hand on the tiller, or the rudder. He laid out his case pointing to information he's referred to in previous Mayor's Breakfasts -- the city's 25 years of action in buying and servicing industrial land. Doing so feeds the strategy to get an increasing share of property taxes from residential into other classes. Speaking to the city's first industrial park, Patullo Ridge, the mayor pointed out how city council in 1983-84 bought the 126 hectares for the park and serviced it with an initial investment of $2 million. It has reaped $4 million in land sales and 845 jobs since, and its industries have paid $2.7 million in property taxes to the city alone. The return on investment for the city took barely two years. Harding also touched on the 21 new projects within the city in 2008, a list capped by the issuance of the building permit for the new Woodstock General Hospital, the story behind which he said had yet to be fully told. He highlighted other city accomplishments such as the Carnegie Library's 100th anniversary, the new recycling and water conservation programs and changes to public transportation. He also highlighted upcoming successes such as the second phase of Cowan Park and the summer's Ontario ParaSport Games in July. He urged those in attendance to tell the city if they're having difficulties, so the city would have the opportunity to do what it can. \"If you're doing badly, we're doing badly. We can't tax what isn't there,\" Harding said. \"We want to help, our staff wants to help, council wants to help.

Over the past year, the United States and Russia have been drifting into a hostile relationship, driven by the U.S. decision to install anti-missile defences in eastern Europe, the war in Georgia last August, and the recent fiasco over Russian natural gas supplies to Europe. There was nervous chatter about a new Cold War, but last month U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden said that the Obama administration was going to \"press the reset button\" in its relations with Russia. Now it has done it. At the NATO summit on March 5, the alliance agreed to resume high-level contacts with Moscow in the NATO-Russia Council, which were suspended after the Georgian war. The following day, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Brussels and gave him a mock reset button. \"There was a rather confrontational approach toward Russia in the prior administration,\" she explained. None of the disputes and misunderstandings between Washington and Moscow came from a hostile intent on either side. Take the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defences being built in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Bush administration said the interceptor missiles and radars of the system were there to intercept nuclear-tipped, long-range missiles fired by Iran and expected the Russians to believe it. Not surprising, the Russians didn't believe it, because Iran has neither missiles capable of reaching the United States nor any nuclear warheads to put on them. So Moscow thought the ABM system was really intended to shoot down Russian missiles and thus undermine the country's ability to deter the United States. Russia worked itself into such a lather over the ABM missiles that President Dmitry Medvedev announced on the day after Barack Obama's election victory last November that short-range Russian missiles would be installed in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave on the Polish border, to destroy those American bases on short notice. But the ABM missiles are in the wrong place to intercept Russian ICBMs, and they don't really work anyway. They have never worked properly, despite tens of billions of dollars poured into the ABM project (a.k.a. \"Star Wars,\" National Missile Defence, etc.) during the past quarter-century. The sole practical result of the program, over the whole of its existence, has been to pour money into the pockets of American defence contractors. But the Russians are too paranoid to accept that, and the program has such strong support in Congress that the Obama administration is merely \"reviewing\" it, rather than cancelling it outright. There are belligerent minor players on both sides, but the Obama administration seems to have sent out orders to squelch them. Last week, for example, a couple of Russian bombers flew to within a couple of hundred kilometres of Canada's Arctic coast, a mere five thousand kilometres from the Canadian capital. Canada scrambled fighters to \"send a strong signal that they should back off and stay out of our airspace,\" according to Defence Minister Peter MacKay, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper sternly declared that Canada would not be intimidated. \"This government has responded every time the Russians have done that,\" he said. \"We will defend our airspace.\" But the Russians were not in Canada's airspace. \"The Russians have conducted themselves professionally,\" responded Gen. Gene Renuart, the American officer who commands NORAD, the Canada-U.S. air defence alliance, in an implicit rebuke to the sabre-rattling Canadians. That is probably just what the Obama administration wants from Russia: a professional relationship between two grownup countries that know and respect the rules. For a start, Hillary Clinton and Sergei Lavrov committed the two countries to negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the end of the year, but more will follow.

Ontario's education minister said Friday she's ready to write regulations compelling school boards to share vacant space with other school boards and community partners. Kathleen Wynne said she would look to write these regulations as a response to recommendations from a report she commissioned on declining enrolment within the province's schools. \"Closing or consolidating schools is one response to declining enrolment -- in some circumstances, the appropriate response,\" the report states. \"However, many circumstances exist in which school closures are undesirable or even unworkable.\" Several of the report's recommendations focus on encouraging and even mandating school boards to seek out partnerships that would allow vacant space in schools to be used rather than remain empty and become a financial burden. \"The (recommendations) that co-terminous boards be required to share or consider shared facilities -- I was looking for that kind of recommendation if the group deemed it appropriate and they have come through with that,\" Wynne said in a Friday phone interview from her constituency office in Toronto. She said she was also encouraged by the recommendation school boards be required to solicit interest from potential community partners for excess space in their schools. \"We're not just going to encourage this, but write regulations to say this is what should happen,\" Wynne said. \"It's a matter of figuring out how to do it and the language of the regulations.\" She was also encouraged by a related recommendation the province look to use empty space in schools to provide its services before building or leasing space elsewhere. She said it would require action beyond her own ministry, but reinforced the concept of community hubs where Ontarians can access as many services as possible. The report was released by Wynne Friday, and contains 21 recommendations for the Ontario government to help school boards and communities understand and deal with the impact of fewer school-aged children in the province. The group recommends the province and all school boards do a better job of explaining what declining enrolment is and how it affects a school's ability to teach students the skills they need to be successful. It wants the province to mandate a single template for reporting changes in enrolment, and that school boards be required to start considering options for small and declining-enrolment schools before reaching the point where closure or consolidation is seen as the only option. Wynne said she was encouraged by the report's tone and the preference within its recommendations ensuring students are given the best possible learning environments and resources. \"The whole point -- to have the programs in place for kids in schools is a critical one and that's why the charts and information included are very valuable to both boards and parent groups,\" Wynne said. \"We can all get a bit more common understanding of the issue.\" Thames Valley District School Board chair James Stewart admitted in a weekend e-mail the devil on the implementation of the report's recommendations would be in the detail of any regulations Wynne issues. \"Anything that lightens the load of the taxpayer and effectively helps our students is welcome in these times,\" Stewart wrote. The report contains extensive recommendations on changes to the province's per-pupil Education Funding Formula, which has been in place since 1998. It recommends shifting more funding -- for example for computers and technology -- from per-pupil to school-based criteria, clarifying and changing temporary declining enrolment funding currently given to school boards. The report states schools in Ontario already have 68,000 fewer students in their desks than in September 1998, and projects schools will have 72,000 fewer students in by September 2012 than they do today.

Bruno figures she's getting a big boost for her buck -- she works in the ultra-competitive and youthful beauty industry, and believes in looking her best in order to attract and keep clients. \"It makes me feel good and when I feel good I'm more creative, successful,\" says Bruno, adding that Botox is an instant pick-me-up, physically and mentally, and its benefits last far longer than any facial or expensive meal out. Bruno isn't the only one refusing to forfeit a facial fix. Dr. David Ellis reports an increase in patients getting non-invasive \"touchie-uppies\" in the past month. \"It gives people an emotional and physical perk -- it's an affordable luxury.\" Expensive surgical procedures are down, he says, but not demand for treatments like injectable fillers, Botox and laser. \"Five patients cancelled surgery in January,\" says the Toronto facial plastic surgeon. Most can't afford time off work to recover and are postponing costly invasive surgery -- up to $20,000 plus -- until the economy stabilizes. Cheaper and cheerful non-surgical \"liquid facelifts,\" combining Botox and Juvederm dermal filler, are popular and can offer \"instantaneous results, a real wow factor,\" says Ellis. In a poll by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 73% of surgeons report an increased or stable demand for Botox, chemical peels and fillers, while 62% report a decrease in surgical procedures. Dr. Wayne Perron, a Calgary plastic surgeon, reports business is steady on all fronts. In this hyped-up doom and gloom, Botox is \"one of the things that we soothe ourselves with.\" Today, cosmetic procedures are viewed as an investment in staying competitive in a cut-throat job market. Freshening up a resume just isn't enough -- many seek an injection of freshness, a glow and a boost of confidence too. Bruno, owner of Decree in Colour salon, says she got tired of feeling and looking withered and weary, so in 2007 she opted for an injectable filler to add volume to her cheeks and Botox on her forehead. She plans to do around her eyes on her next quarterly visit to Ellis. She says that her clients look to her for inspiration. \"You have to be the power of example,\" says Bruno, who embraces a healthy and active lifestyle. Dr. Barry Lycka isn't surprised people aren't giving up their Botox. \"Once people have it done, it becomes terribly addictive.\" People value looking good and Botox offers instant results with no downtime -- \"you look fresh, like you've been on a vacation for six weeks,\" says the Edmonton cosmetic dermatologist, adding business is at 100% capacity. Invasive cosmetic surgery has been on the decline for the past 10 years \"as people are looking for quicker, better and easier procedures, and now the economy is forcing that even more,\" he says. Many women view cosmetic procedures as a way to get a competitive edge in the workplace, reveals a survey by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 13% would consider having a cosmetic medical procedure specifically to make them more confident and more competitive in the job market. 3% say they've already had a cosmetic procedure to increase their perceived value in the workplace. 73% believe youthful appearance plays a part in getting hired, getting a promotion or getting new clients. 80% think having a cosmetic procedure can boost a person's confidence. Antonella Bruno would prefer to spend money on Botox injections than spend it on other areas of her life.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Toronto", "latitude": 43.7001, "longitude": -79.4163}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Calgary", "latitude": 51.0501, "longitude": -114.085}, {"name": "Edmonton", "latitude": 53.5501, "longitude": -113.469}, {"name": "American", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

If a recent blue-ribbon confab for business leaders, analysts and economists is any indication, Canadians who believe the Great Crash will be over soon should probably think about changing meds. An international poll just out shows that despite all the economic doom and gloom -- not to mention terminal winter blahs -- Canadians are among the most optimistic people in the world. The Environics survey, for instance, found 70% of Canucks don't expect the recession to last more than two years. But among those most likely in the know, there is a growing crescendo of expert opinion that anyone who still sees the global economic glass as half-full must be drinking the other half, and it ain't water. Yesterday, Parliament's watchdog of fiscal funny business, federal budget officer Kevin Page, told a Commons committee the Conservative government's latest projections are already being washed away in a tidal wave of red ink. He predicts federal deficits and unemployment will be far higher than government projections as the economy continues to tank. Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, who recently predicted the economy would bounce back by the end of the year, is now signalling he, too, is tossing the rose-coloured glasses. But the really depressing news came out of a closed-door symposium in Toronto this week exploring \"what lies ahead for the global economy.\" The conclusion is the current global malaise will be much deeper, last much longer, and be far more complicated to cure than most governments are willing to admit. The road to recovery, the experts are saying, is anything but around the corner. Think at least three to five years away. The iconic David Dodge, former Bank of Canada governor and a federal deputy minister of finance for years before that, told the ballroom full of corporate execs that the economy is toast this year, and going to get worse before it gets any better. \"The year 2009 is going to be a very dark page in economic history,\" Dodge told the pinstripe crowd that became decidedly downcast as the day progressed. Dodge agrees with the need for major deficit spending to keep the economy moving in the wake of both business and consumer spending going to the bottom. \"There is virtually nothing policy-makers can do in the coming months that will do anything to affect (economic) outcomes this year,\" Dodge said. Similarly, there will be no instant miracles from the central banks' cutting their key lending rates to near zero. Dodge said even in good economic times when the market is awash with borrowing and spending, interest rate cuts can take nine months or more to have their desired impact. That delay could be even longer in this so-called \"balance sheet recession,\" when economies shift from borrowing and spending to saving and debt reduction. One result, Dodge said, would likely be global unemployment continuing to climb into 2010. Other luminaries speaking at the Toronto symposium included Richard Koo, chief economist for Nomura Securities in Tokyo; Martin Wolf, associate editor of the Financial Times of London; and William A. Macdonald, a Toronto-based strategic consultant and one of this country's engaging thinkers. While they didn't address Canada's economic problems directly -- the fiscal fate of this country, like others, is in the hands of the U.S. and China -- it seems clear the odds of the federal government returning to balanced budgets in the next five years are slim to nil. As for your decimated stock portfolio, don't expect it to bounce back to where it was anytime soon -- apparently about 40% of its value was just air in the bubble now burst.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Canadians", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -96.0}, {"name": "Canadians", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -96.0}, {"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -96.0}, {"name": "Toronto", "latitude": 43.7001, "longitude": -79.4163}, {"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -96.0}, {"name": "Toronto", "latitude": 43.7001, "longitude": -79.4163}, {"name": "Tokyo", "latitude": 35.685, "longitude": 139.751}, {"name": "London", "latitude": 51.5084, "longitude": -0.125533}, {"name": "Toronto", "latitude": 43.7001, "longitude": -79.4163}, {"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -96.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 105.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Elliot Ferguson photoJim Harrison of the Woodstock District Chamber of Commerce says it is likely the proposed harmonized sales tax will cost consumers more money. The local reaction to Thursday's Ontario budget speech could best be described as mixed. While local political and business leaders liked aspects of the Liberal budget, there were serious misgivings about the harmonization of the provincial sales tax with the federal GST. The most scathing local indictment of this harmonization came from Oxford MPP Ernie Hardeman, who characterized this shift as the largest tax increase in the province's history. While Hardeman was supportive of the concept of a harmonization, saying he had no argument against more efficient methods of taxation, he was critical of the Liberal government's approach. \"This will be a massive burden on the average citizens of the Province of Ontario,\" he said following Finance Minister Dwight Duncan's budget speech. Because this harmonization will result in the inclusion of goods and services previously exempt from provincial tax, including gasoline and heating fuel, Hardeman said Ontarians would suffer an eight per cent price increase on many staples. The result, he said, would be the generation of an additional $2.3 billion in annual sales tax revenue by 2012. \"That's the reality of it, and that's all on the backs of average citizens,\" the Progressive Conservative agriculture critic said. For Jim Harrison, the president of the Woodstock District Chamber of Commerce, the harmonized sales tax represented a mixed bag. While harmonization has long been a position of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Harrison was concerned that adding an eight per cent sales tax to previously exempted goods and services would mean an unwelcome increase to operating costs to Ontario businesses. \"When you add that one key element, it really shakes your opinion of the overall effect,\" he said. \"The increased tax burden on the new items, we'll have to wait and see what happens.\" Harrison suggested some of the mitigation measures intended by the provincial government to offset this potential burden, including personal income tax reductions and one-time thrice yearly \"rebate\" cheques, implied the impact of harmonization could be fairly significant. \"There's an inherent feeling the blow is bigger than the reform,\" he said. Like Hardeman, Harrison suggested the provincial government should have looked at reducing its portion of the harmonized sales tax to offer Ontarians something in the range of 10 per cent to 11 per cent. At the same time, Harrison said the Liberal government was wise to delay the institution of the single sales tax until July 2010. \"That will give everyone some time to understand the process,\" he said. While the impact of this new \"single, value-added tax\" was viewed with some trepidation, local leaders were more impressed with other budget-speech announcements. The promise that garnered the most local praise was the allocation of $32.5 billion in new infrastructure spending, an investment that Duncan estimated would create 300,000 jobs. Even as a member of the Opposition, Hardeman couldn't fault the Liberal government for putting more money into hospitals, roads, schools and affordable housing. \"I can't see anything ... but good (coming from the infrastructure investment),\" Harrison agreed. \"I feel quite positive about that.\" While cautiously optimistic about the announcement of the infrastructure money, Oxford's municipal leaders had questions about the actual details of the eventual disbursement. Noting that his town had been overlooked by provincial infrastructure funding programs in the past, Tillsonburg Mayor Stephen Molnar said his council would have to ensure \"we get fair, equitable and sustainable treatment.\" \" (We) embrace the opportunity for a larger portion of our residents' federal and provincial tax dollars ... to assist in the investment in their own infrastructure,\" Molnar said. Woodstock Mayor Michael Harding was also cautious in his appraisal of the promised infrastructure money, saying the municipality would likely not receive the details for some time. Like Molnar, Harding hopes the substance of any new infrastructure funding programs would be devoid of any cumbersome provisions. \"Hopefully, they will follow very, very quickly and hopefully there isn't a lot of red tape,\" the mayor said. \"There appears to be a lot of negotiation going on in the background on how quickly the money will flow and what those amounts will be. Harding, though, was impressed with the provincial government's promise to provide more than $1 billion for a combination of social housing renovations and new affordable housing projects over the next two years. Harding, an advocate for affordable housing, applauded these \"additional supports\" for helping the province's most vulnerable. \"These are badly needed across the province and in Oxford,\" the Woodstock mayor said. \"As are the 4,500 affordable housing units that are coming, according to their math.\" Hardeman, though, did express concerns about the long-term impact of the overall government spending. While acknowledging the need for spending to stimulate the sluggish economy, he warned the $14.1-billion deficit represented by the 2009 budget would be the highest in the province's history. Oxford's political and business leaders were also positive about the provincial budget's promise to reduce both personal income and corporate income taxes. Starting in July 2010, Ontarians will receive a 16.5 per cent tax cut on the first $38,848 of taxable income while most businesses will enjoy a corporate tax decrease of 14.3 per cent to 18 per cent. While he approved these tax cuts, Hardeman said his party had advocated a similar policy for the past several years as a tool to encourage additional investment in Ontario. \"It's something our party has been telling them since 2003,\" Hardeman said. \"I'm just disappointed it took five years to find that answer.\" Harrison simply described the tax cuts as \"good long-term strategies for growth,\" saying the benefits wouldn't be fully realized for a few years. Molnar, while supportive of strategic tax cuts, wondered why these measures weren't being introduced a little sooner. Mentioning the promised \"rebates,\" including the one-time $1,000 cheque for eligible Ontario families, Molnar said these stimulus measures should be implemented in the short term. \"If it's about stimulus, that means money in the pocket,\" he said. \"Do it as son as possible. If you're cutting a cheque, cut it now.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Woodstock", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.7497}, {"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Oxford", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.833}, {"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Ontarians", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Woodstock", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.7497}, {"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Ontarians", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Oxford", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.833}, {"name": "Tillsonburg", "latitude": 42.8501, "longitude": -80.733}, {"name": "Woodstock", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.7497}, {"name": "Oxford", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.833}, {"name": "Woodstock", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.7497}, {"name": "Oxford", "latitude": 43.1334, "longitude": -80.833}, {"name": "Ontarians", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}, {"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 49.2501, "longitude": -84.4998}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Tina Vehof consoles her youngest son Joshua, 4, as they walk up their rural laneway, his tears contrasting the boundless energy of his three older siblings running up ahead. The four children, bubbling with emotion, have just gotten off their school bus after a long day that started shortly before 7 a.m., when Tina woke them to get dressed for their bus to school some nine hours earlier. \"I got them to bed at a good time last night, but this is what happens,\" Vehof explained. Vehof is livid at the unsafe length of their morning bus ride and frustrated no one in either the busing consortium or the Catholic school board has responded to her concerns. This scene of wound, wired energy and frustration plays itself out almost daily as the kids arrive home from being cooped up on the bus and at school all day. Despite the 40-plus minutes they've just spent on the bus now, the children are picked up for the ride to school between 7:15 and 7:30 a.m. They don't arrive at Holy Family Catholic French Immersion School until almost 9 a.m., putting their morning bus commute well above the 70-minute maximum time in their school board's transportation policy. \"The children can't cope with these times,\" Tina Vehof said. \"I can see they're suffering because of it. They're always tired and their anxiety level is high.\" Vehof said the March break provided respite from this schedule and that in the few days after school resumed last week she again noticed her children's fatigue and anxiety levels rising. Vehof is upset her complaints to the London District Catholic School Board and its Southwestern Ontario Student Transportation Services consortium haven't been resolved. She said she has been following the proper complaint procedure, first approaching her children's principal, and then e-mailing a letter to the consortium. Her letter is one of five sent by families whose 11 children are on the route, with drop-offs at Holy Family, St. Michael's Catholic School and St. Mary's High School. \"Children simply cannot tolerate the extended hours on a bus,\" Vehof's letter read. \"There (have) been numerous incidents of unacceptable behaviour already reported (slashing bus seats, burning shoes on the bus and much more), done by the high school children. \"Children are tired, irritable and overall are not able to cope.\" One of the other letters explained how the route originates in Tavistock before picking up several students in the vicinity of the 16th Line of East Zorra-Tavistock and Oxford Road 5 -- the Vehofs live in this area -- before heading through Bright and onto Plattsville. St. Mary's students are dropped off first in Woodstock, followed by Holy Family students and lastly St. Michael's pupils. Student Transportation Services general manager Maureen Heath explained in an e-mail Monday she was aware of the concern with this bus route, attributing conditions on the route to the vast geography at play for the schools. She also confirmed an efficiency review led to the elimination of a bus route in the area. \"Vast geography in rural areas and program options relative to a student's location are constraints which sometimes make the 70-minute window impossible to achieve,\" Heath wrote in the e-mail. In a subsequent phone interview, Heath acknowledged many of the students bused to school in the district are rural, but there is still a variance between boards in interpreting what a 'normal' rural bus situation should look like. Vehof refuted any attempt to explain the long bus ride as simply a factor of living in a rural environment. She said and the other families have the right to send their children to a French immersion Catholic school and Holy Family is the only option. Even if she were to switch her children to St. Michael's for the English Catholic program, they would ride the same bus route and their transportation times would remain the same. Only in switching to the closest English public school -- Hickson Central Public School -- would the bus ride get shorter. Heath said it's possible conditions may improve next school year, as the consortium will be changing bus routes again with the goal of increasing the number of shared routes. \"I'm not in a position to make guarantees, but the intent is to go back through our routes -- particularly in areas we're aware of -- with a fresh set of eyes,\" Heath said.

In the book, Where There's an Inheritance: Stories From the World of Two Wills Lawyers (Continental Atlantic Publications), Kotzer shares the stories he says gave himself and co-author Barry Fisher a deeper appreciation for life. Given the recession, Kotzer's getting media attention from CNN to the New York Times for the practical advice gleaned from tales of greed, rage, anger, love and empathy. The University of Windsor Law graduate said he often sees people who are at the end of their life, who need to decide important details such as the fate of their family. One woman, Kotzer said, had terminal cancer and he had to ask her who would raise her seven-year-old daughter once she died. \"I can't give her up,\" she told Kotzer, and started to cry. She continued to weep in his office. \"Who's going to know the way I comb her hair? \"Who's going to know the way I read her stories and the way I pinch her nose?\" the mother asked desperately. The ordeal was even tough for Kotzer, who admits he often has to fight to hold back tears. That simple life lesson -- learning to appreciate what you've got -- is not uncommon in Kotzer's practice. He said one rainy, cold, windy day he had to meet a client in her car because she wasn't mobile enough to come into the office. It was the first time she left the hospital in a year and when Kotzer joined her in a car out front to discuss her will, her hand was out the window, collecting the raindrops that poured down. \"We looked at that day as two totally different things. To me it was frustration, work and aggravation, and to her it was probably the most beautiful day that she will see for the rest of her life.\" His latest book follows two others, The Family Fight: Planning To Avoid It, and The Family War: Winning the Inheritance Battle, written to help families understand the laws and documents that govern wills and inheritance. Special for Sun Media readers, if you buy the book before April 15 you will receive Family Fight, Planning to Avoid It, for free plus shipping. Kotzer also offers free will reviews in Ontario to make sure that a will is up to date and not a recipe for disaster. In some cases, the law is not enough to solve inheritance disputes, so Kotzer relies on another route. He is also a professional songwriter who writes to touch the hearts of people. \"To me, the most important thing is our family and I'm seeing it's being destroyed in front of me. I'm on a mission to save families through inheritance disputes,\" said Kotzer, who also delivers his message through song. One of his songs, Photos In A Drawer, is often played while he is doing radio shows. Sometimes people need to realize what is really important to them, he said. Kotzer also uses music as a vehicle to compensate for the constraints he feels while working with the law.

Richard Donovan, author of \u201cPaddling the Wild Neches,\u201d will be speaking in Athens on Monday at the monthly meeting of the East Texas Environmental Concerns Organization. One of Texas\u2019 last wild rivers, the Neches forms the eastern boundary of Henderson County and meanders over 400 miles from northwest of Tyler to the Gulf of Mexico near Beaumont. The Neches and its bottomland forests are home to a variety of wildlife -- bald eagles, deer, squirrels, otters, wood ducks, mallards, wild turkeys, and colorful songbirds. The public is invited to this event. For hundreds of years the Neches River Valley has nourished a succession of peoples -- Caddo and Atakapa Indians, then Spanish, French, and Mexican explorers, next early \u201cTexian\u201d settlers, finally the Anglo-Americans who came in droves to the new state of Texas. The Neches sustains half a million people, meeting the needs of municipalities and industries. Along the way, the river nourishes the forests of the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge, the Davy Crockett National Forest with its Big Slough Wilderness and Neches Overlook, the Angelina National Forest with its Upland Island Wilderness, the popular Martin Dies Jr. State Park, the famed Big Thicket National Preserve, and thousands of acres of private land. In June 2006, the director of the U.S. Fish and wildlife service gave approval to the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge on a beautiful stretch of the upper Neches River in Anderson and Cherokee counties. With the donation of the first acre of land to the refuge the following August, the Refuge was officially established. Now the Texas water development board and the city of Dallas, who want to build a reservoir on the Refuge site, are suing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to try and overturn the Refuge. The 25,000 acres proposed for inclusion within the proposed refuge boundary contain some of the best remaining and least disturbed bottomland hardwood forest habitat left in Texas, rated as \u201cPriority 1\u201d by the USFWS. Adding land to the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge will protect vital habitat for wildlife, including waterfowl and migratory songbirds, provide wonderful hunting and other outdoor recreational opportunities for the public, and serve as an economic boon to surrounding communities. The 540 national wildlife refuges in the lower 48 states fueled more than $809 million in sales.

A 36-year-old Palestine man who successfully eluded authorities following a weekend traffic stop was arrested Wednesday at an Anderson County residence. James Ernest Barnett, 36, of Palestine was arrested without incident around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at a residence on CR 367 off of U.S. 79, approximately 2 miles east of Palestine, according to Anderson County Sheriff Greg Taylor. The arrest was made after Anderson County Crimestoppers had received a tip from a private citizen concerning Barnett\u2019s whereabouts. Taylor said he and about five other representatives of the Anderson County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u201cswooped in on\u201d the house after receiving the tip. \u201cHe (Barnett) didn\u2019t have a chance to run,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe had him out of the house before he knew what happened.\u201d Three other male subjects inside the residence were not arrested, the sheriff added. Late Sunday morning, Barnett led an Anderson County sheriff\u2019s deputy on a high speed chase into Freestone County after he had been stopped in an \u201colder model\u201d Ford Explorer for \u201ca non-visible registration sticker\u201d inside the Palestine city limits, according to Taylor. After failing to provide proof of liability insurance, authorities have said Barnett declined the officer\u2019s request to step out of his vehicle and then sped off -- first leading the officer on several city streets before heading out of town in a westwardly direction on U.S. 79. The driver took the U.S. 84 turnoff towards Fairfield before turning onto FM 489 and then onto Freestone County Road 360, according to the sheriff. Wright ultimately lost control of his squad car on the county road, with the suspect continuing approximately 2 more miles before abandoning his vehicle and fleeing on foot, according to Taylor. A Texas Parks & Wildlife Department game warden who had joined the pursuit attempted to apprehend the suspect, but lost him in the woods, the sheriff stated. At the time of Barnett\u2019s arrest Wednesday morning, Taylor said a 1996 Chevrolet Z-71 pickup was parked in the driveway of the residence. The vehicle was reported stolen Sunday in Freestone County, approximately 2 miles from where the suspect abandoned the Ford Explorer, according to the sheriff. \u201cInside that truck in a cigarette package in the console was a small amount of methamphetamine that he claimed,\u201d Taylor said. Barnett already had a \u201cblue warrant\u201d which reflects a parole violation, according to Taylor. Barnett was transported to the Anderson County Jail following his arrest and will be charged locally with evading arrest/detention with a motor vehicle and possession of a controlled substance less than 1 gram, the sheriff stated. The suspect also faces unauthorized use of a motor vehicle charges in Freestone County in relation to the stolen truck. --------- Paul Stone may be contacted via e-mail at pstone@palestineherald.com", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Freestone County", "latitude": 31.7002, "longitude": -96.2669}, {"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Fairfield", "latitude": 31.7246, "longitude": -96.1652}, {"name": "Freestone County", "latitude": 31.7002, "longitude": -96.2669}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Freestone County", "latitude": 31.7002, "longitude": -96.2669}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Freestone County", "latitude": 31.7002, "longitude": -96.2669}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Gary Wilson, 54, of Palestine was sentenced to two years in a state jail facility Friday at the Anderson County Courthouse by 87th State District Judge Deborah Oakes Evans. In mid-January, Wilson had pled guilty to the state jail felony offense of evading arrest with a motor vehicle, stemming from an August 2007 incident during which he fled from local police after they had received a report of an intoxicated driver, according to Stanley Sokolowski, assistant district attorney for Anderson County.

The vehicle\u2019s driver ran multiple stop signs and red lights and also traveled in the wrong lane of traffic at one point, he added. Wilson ultimately pulled into the driveway of a residence in the 1200 block of North John Street, according to Sokolowski. \u201cHe (Wilson) got out of the vehicle...he didn\u2019t stop and they (officers) had to take him to the ground,\u201d the assistant district attorney said. Officers believed Wilson to be intoxicated and discovered \u201cat least two open containers\u201d in his vehicle, Sokolowski said. Wilson already had an \u201cextensive criminal history relating to DWIs\u201d and also was sentenced to five years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on an arson conviction in the mid-1990s, according to Sokolowski. Wilson was sentenced Friday following a hearing of approximately 45 minutes. Although receiving the maximum state jail sentence, he was not assessed a fine. Some may portray the August 2007 incident as a \u201cvictimless crime\u201d since no one was injured, but Sokolowski disagrees, saying innocent peoples\u2019 lives are put at risk when an intoxicated driver flees from police and runs red lights and stop signs in the process. \u201cMy feeling is it\u2019s one of the most dangerous things that can occur out there,\u201d Sokolowski said. --------- Paul Stone may be contacted via e-mail at pstone@palestineherald.com", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Anderson County", "latitude": 31.8168, "longitude": -95.6669}, {"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "Palestine", "latitude": 31.7621, "longitude": -95.6308}, {"name": "West Palestine Avenue", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Delmar Street", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "North John Street", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

A few unexpected expenses might require the Crestwood Board of Education to amend their budget in May, Superintendent Lorraine Bailey informed the board Wednesday night during the regular meeting. Bailey explained if the budget is off by a certain percentage, law requires the budget be amended. Tuition to Paris High School was more than expected this year, which Bailey said was due to higher costs divided by fewer students. An additional teacher was also hired midyear. Despite the unexpected expenses, Bailey said the school has \u201cdone very well staying in line with what we budgeted.\u201d During the meeting, board members also started looking at summer projects. The roof over the cafeteria and kitchen will be replaced as well as patch work to the rest of the roof with the bid being awarded to Martinsville Roofing at a cost of $38,117. The roof project was approved for Health/Life/Safety funds. The school is also in need of a new chair lift. The current lift is not operable at this time. The bid was awarded to Garaventa Lift, who originally installed the lift at the school. Bailey said the company is very reputable. The H/L/S amendment for the lift has not yet been approved, Bailey noted; however the preliminary paper work came back with no concerns. If the amendment is not approved, the money will come from the Operations and Maintenance Fund. Several years ago, the board looked into tuckpointing the school. The bids came back higher than anticipated and the board decided to hold off on the project. Now, the problem is getting worse and tuckpointing is inevitable. The project bid was awarded to Midwest Restoration of Paris in the amount of $12,680. The board also voted to replace to busses through Midwest Transit. The school will lease a two year old 65 passenger bus at a cost of $60,100 before trade-in at a value of $6,600; and another two-year-old 65 passenger bus at a cost of $59,700 before trade-in of $6,100. The school calendar was approved for next year and is the same calendar as District 95. The first day of school will be Aug. 17 and the final day of school, if no snow days are used, will be May 26.

HUME \u2013 A member delegation of the Shiloh School District Curriculum Committee met with the board of education Monday night to discuss the fate of Block 8 scheduling. Principal Mark Hettmansberger presented the main report and said the committee has serious misgivings about continuing with Block 8 for high school students. He noted current research is divided on the value of the scheduling system that uses double periods on alternating days to teach subject matter. According to Hettmansberger, the research indicates that Block 8 is most successful in schools that have student bodies composed of high achieving individuals from affluent backgrounds. It seems to be less viable in districts like Shiloh where more than 30 percent of the students have individualized learning plans and the free and reduced lunch count approaches 50 percent, indicating a significant poverty rate. \u201cFrom the management standpoint, the block schedule is real easy,\u201d said Hettmansberger. \u201cIt makes my life easier because we don\u2019t have so many period changes during the day, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s best for our students.\u201d Hettmansberger said the curriculum committee cast a unanimous vote to abandon Block 8 in favor of the more traditional eight-period day. The vote, however, was split when the faculty was provided the opportunity to express an opinion. Slightly more than half of the teachers favored the eight-period day, and the other half was divided between those wanting a modified Block 8 and those desiring to retain the present system. Other members of the curriculum committee spoke to the identified weaknesses of the Block 8 system. District technology coordinator Terry Sullivan said his perception is that Block 8 results in too much down time as the teachers commonly give students 15 to 20 minutes at the end of each double-period to start on assignments. \u201cThe idea being that responsible students will take advantage of that time,\u201d said Sullivan, adding the reality is much different as he sees computer use and on-line access spike near the end of each period. Board member Dana Hales, a retired educator, questioned the validity of faulting Block 8 for the students using the end of the period time in unproductive ways. \u201cThat last 15-to-20-minute shut down is a teacher guidance issue,\u201d said Hales. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be getting on the computers to play.\u201d Hettmansberger agreed, while pointing out that none of Shiloh\u2019s teachers ever received training for using Block 8 effectively after it was adopted in the 1990s and new teachers graduating from college are not familiar with the approach either. \u201cIf we continue with it, I will be coming back to the board asking for money to do proper training,\u201d said Hettmansberger. Math teacher Debra Akers said the length of the classes contributes to the students shutting down at end of the period. \u201cWhen you get into algebra II and trigonometry and are trying to cover three-to-four classes (in the double period), the kids get glassy-eyed trying to learn five new things,\u201d said Akers. \u201cAt the end of the lesson, the kids consider class over and put their books away.\u201d Shiloh\u2019s other math teacher, Corey White, added that current college teacher preparation classes are stressing the need to break material into smaller blocks for presentation in a more condensed time. He recounted participating in a recent college exercise that set a preferred time limit of 30 minutes for presenting the information. Guidance counselor Amber Grenda said the every-other-day approach in Block 8 is a real detriment to students who have difficulty retaining information. She said such students need the repetition of daily classes to avoid forgetting what they learn. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of hoping this will help our lower level students remember,\u201d said Grenda. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard from our higher achieving students that they don\u2019t like the 20-minute-end-of-class which breaks down.\u201d District superintendent Gary Lewis added switching to an eight-period day will reintroduce a study hall into the schedule \u2013 something not possible in the Block 8 system. According to Lewis, a dedicated study hall period may prove helpful as the district copes with the unfunded Response to Intervention (RTI) mandate requiring schools to take steps that provide early identification of when students are struggling in a class and then intervene to correct the problem before a student gets so far behind that an individual learning plan is needed. The superintendent foresees using the study hall period for helping students identified through RTI get back on track. Hettmansberger said switching to the eight-period day will require Shiloh High School students to take a minimum of seven classes per term to meet the school\u2019s graduation requirement. He was not enthralled with offering a study hall to all students. \u201cThe administration will strongly push students to take eight classes,\u201d said Hettmansberger.

The goal is to plant 25 to 30 native shade trees, not ornamental trees, on the boulevards and street sides (not backyards) of private yards in the spring of 2009. In addition, Dick hopes have another 50 to 60 trees planted this fall and each fall thereafter. City grounds/maintenance supervisor Teresa Bach jumped at the chance to be a part of the project. Bach is also a Master Gardener, who are also helping with the project. The Edgar County Community Foundation agreed to be the custodians of the funds for the project, and also agreed to kick-start the project by funding the first 25 trees to be planted. Dick was inspired to begin the project by the plaque at Schwartz park that reads \u201cThe true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit.\u201d \u201c[Trees] provide shade by moderating the radiant energy from the sun, they absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants and give off oxygen in exchange.

A young woman accused of driving the vehicle that killed Terry A. Corbin in a hit-and-run accident made her first court appearance Thursday morning. Ashley L. Evans, 26, of Paris, was in the custody of the Edgar County Sheriff\u2019s Department for an appearance before Judge David W. Lewis. The purpose of the hearing was to advise Evans of the charge against her, explain her trial rights as a U.S. citizen and to address the issue of legal counsel. Evans is charged with a single Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident that resulted in death and failing to report the accident to law enforcement. Lewis advised Evans that a penitentiary sentence of between four and 15 years is possible upon conviction. Probation is another sentencing option. While awaiting her turn before the bench, Evans often sat with her face in her hands. She spoke softly during the hearing and said little except to answer questions from the court, although she did say she will try to hire defense counsel. She was remanded back to custody on a $50,000 bond. Also appearing was Guy C. Harminson, 26, of Paris. Harminson is charged with a Class 4 felony of obstruction of justice, alleging he provided investigators with false information about the accident in order to prevent Evans\u2019 arrest. Evans and Harminson share a rural Paris address. Harminson said he cannot afford legal counsel and public defender L. Kaye DeSelms was assigned to the case. He was remanded to custody on a $15,000 bond.

Paris and Henry County is rich in both history and art opportunities and the Lee Academy for the Arts is an example of how both are thriving here. The 2008-09 Leadership Henry County class had the opportunity to tour the Lee Academy building during its Wednesday session. Every time I visit Lee Academy, I am impressed by its beautiful hardwood floors and old-fashioned facade. The feet of thousands of youngsters have trod on those floors, and as we recently heard, the feet of little ones still grace the classrooms there where dancing, drama and music classes keep the school alive with artistic activity. The school also has a wide variety of youth and adult classes such as painting, pottery, photography, ballroom dancing, yoga and piano lessons. Ray Harding of the Lee School Association gave a presentation showing how far the school building has come since 2001 when the association formed a committee dedicated to preserving the school. These people who invested their hearts and souls into seeing the school brought back to its original glory were former students of the school and also people who had a love of Paris history. In 2002, a feasibility study was done to determine the best use for the building, and in 2003 the association decided to use the building for the arts. \u201cWe went about this in a pretty organized way,\u201d said Harding. \u201cSomebody suggested making luxury apartments out of the building, but we didn\u2019t want to do that because it would ruin the flavor of the school.\u201d The first two classrooms opened for use in 2004. Since then, the entire building has undergone renovation with several upstairs classrooms being rented out to local artists. The Lunchroom at Lee is the most recent exciting renovation to the building, which is a room with a kitchen, stage and audio system that can be rented for special events like dinners and receptions, performances and meetings. As Harding showed the class before and after pictures of the renovations, audible gasps could be heard because of the remarkable transformation of this historical house of learning. Lee Academy serves about 300 students a year and teachers are both paid and volunteer. The total cost of the renovation was $350,000; the debt remaining is about $43,000. Harding said the association hopes to receive more members who want to financially help the school, and also hopes the Lunchroom rentals will be able to help the school financially. \u201cWe have two hundred members, which is pretty good, and we appreciate all of them,\u201d he said. More information about the school can be found on its Web site at . We also met with Stephanie Tayloe, county archivist, who showed us several interesting documents in the county archives located at the Central Community Service Center on Jones Bend Road Extended. Some of the documents there date back to almost 200 years ago. \u201cThe archives here are a hidden treasure of Henry County,\u201d said Tayloe. \u201cPeople do not realize the importance of these papers.\u201d She has been involved with archiving the county records for about 12 years. \u201cI love it and I hope I can do it for the rest of my life,\u201d she said. The boxes and boxes of records previously were stored in the attic of the Henry County Courthouse where pigeons, mice and other varmints wreaked havoc on them for years. About 14 years ago, the process of cleaning and archiving the records began, and even though countless hours of work have been dedicated to the cause, there is still work to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s been a labor of love,\u201d said Tayloe. Linda Dunlap also works with the archives. \u201cWe work all of the time and it\u2019s one hundred percent volunteer,\u201d said Dunlap. The archivists transcribe the documents, type them up and file them on a computer and make books out of them \u2014 some of which can be purchased. Tayloe showed several documents which have historical significance and several boxes of estate settlements going back to the 1820s. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a Southerner yet who wasn\u2019t done wrong by the will,\u201d Tayloe said smiling. \u201cThey squabble over everything right down to the last iron skillet.\u201d Earlier in the day the class also heard a presentation by David Webb, county historian; toured the Krider Performing Arts Center; toured the genealogy department at Rhea Public Library; heard a presentation by Mary Lodge, Paris-Henry County Arts Council director; and toured the Paris-Henry County Heritage Center with director Norma Steele (a.k.a. \u201cNaughty Norma\u201d).

CHATTANOOGA (AP) \u2014 Methamphetamine \u201ccooks\u201d are secretly converting hundreds of motel and hotel rooms into covert drug labs \u2014 leaving behind a toxic mess for unsuspecting customers and housekeeping crews. They are places where drug-makers can go unnoticed, mixing the chemicals needed for the highly addictive stimulant in a matter of hours before slipping out the next morning. The dangerous contaminants can lurk on countertops, carpets and bathtubs, and chemical odors that might be a warning clue to those who follow can be masked by tobacco smoke and other scents. Motels can be an attractive alternative for drug makers seeking to avoid a police raid on their own homes. \u201cThey can seize the trailer or seize your house but they can\u2019t seize a motel room,\u201d said Sullivan Smith, director of emergency services at Cookeville Regional Medical Center in north-central Tennessee. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration records obtained by The Associated Press show that states reported finding evidence of drug-making in 1,789 motel and hotel rooms in the past five years \u2014 and that\u2019s just those the authorities found. Some cleanup professionals hired to make the travelers\u2019 havens livable again say most of their work is done on properties where a meth lab was discovered long after the fact. The number of clandestine labs that are never found is difficult to pin down. There was a slight uptick in hotel and motel lab busts reported to the DEA in 2008 from the previous year, with 149 in 2006, 87 in 2007 and 127 in 2008. The tally was 461 in 2005 and 965 in 2004, before there were restrictions on purchasing over-the-counter decongestants often used as ingredients. The DEA count is based on states that reported labs. The toxins can linger for days if meth lab hygienists wearing hazmat suits don\u2019t clean living areas. The cleanups cost anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000. Even short-term exposure to vapors and residue where the drug is smoked or cooked can cause eye and skin irritation, vomiting, rashes, asthma problems and other respiratory issues. \u201cIt probably happens all the time,\u201d said John Martyny, a National Jewish Medical and Research Center associate professor who is also an industrial hygienist and meth researcher. \u201cThe difficulty is, how do you make that attribution? You might think it is from cigarette smoking.\u201d Martyny said health effects from long-term exposure to the drug making are not known because the clandestine labs did not become widespread until the 1990s. The volatile labs can be set up in less than four hours inside a hotel or motel room, according to The American Hotel and Lodging Association. Methods vary for making the drug, but the equipment can be simple enough to fit in a single backpack: A large soft drink bottle with some rubber tubing, duct tape, batteries, refrigerant packs and a decongestant that contains ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. Regardless of the complexity, \u201cYou are going to leave behind meth and caustic or potentially hazardous chemicals,\u201d said Tommy Farmer, director of Tennessee\u2019s Methamphetamine Task Force. \u201cThe smart ones come in about 10 o\u2019clock at night and they make it all night and are out of there by 8 a.m,\u201d said Joseph McInerney, president and CEO of the association. Environmental services specialist John Nale of Chattanooga, who is licensed to clean up meth labs, said tests he has conducted for buyers of motel properties have shown chemicals from clandestine labs that were never previously discovered and reported. Joe Mazzuca, operations manager at Meth Lab Cleanup Co. in Post Falls, Idaho, said he has tested pricey hotel rooms in Idaho and Utah and discovered contaminants where no one previously suspected a meth lab had been. \u201cSeventy percent of the work the company does are properties that were never busted,\u201d Mazzuca said. McInerney, the hotel and lodging association president, said few meth labs are set up in hotels compared with the industry renting about 3 million rooms a day. He said operators typically are vigilant about monitoring for any meth problems. In East Ridge, on Interstate 75 a few miles from Chattanooga, police last month uncovered one lab in the Cascade Motel. They posted a quarantine sign on the door of the room until the owner pays for a cleanup and the affected area is cleared for use. Police investigator Josh Creel said he and other officers located the chemicals, tubing and glassware that were being used when they made the arrests at the Cascade Motel. He advised the manager to leave the door and window open for several days in preparation for the cleanup, which involved replacing many of the furnishings.

According to a report by Whitaker, money was taken from two different unlocked cash drawers inside the funeral home and two filing cabinets also had been opened. The theft occurred sometime between 9 p.m. Thursday and 8:30 a.m. Friday. There were no signs of forced entry and all doors and windows were locked. A Paris woman was arrested at her residence Friday night for filing a false report and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Nikki Lynn Barlow, 18, of 208 Routon St. was arrested by PPD Patrolman Amanda Forrest. Barlow allegedly helped a runaway teenager hide from police and denied that the runaway was at the residence. The runaway was later found hiding under a mattress at the residence. Barlow\u2019s bond was set at $5,000 and she is scheduled to appear Thursday in General Sessions Court.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Paris", "latitude": 36.302, "longitude": -88.3267}, {"name": "Lone Oak Road", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Paris", "latitude": 36.302, "longitude": -88.3267}, {"name": "Paris", "latitude": 36.302, "longitude": -88.3267}, {"name": "Henry County", "latitude": 36.3334, "longitude": -88.3167}, {"name": "Paris", "latitude": 36.302, "longitude": -88.3267}, {"name": "N.

A new $2.6 million independent-living facility in Marshall for people with disabilities is fully occupied and has a waiting list. The last tenant at Fithian House, named after the late Bradford Woods Mayor Ted Fithian, will move in next month, said Dick Lynch, executive director of the Spina Bifida Association of Western Pennsylvania. Fithian House is on 32 acres owned by the Woodlands Foundation, a nonprofit agency on the Marshall/Bradford Woods border. The Woodlands serves more than 5,000 people each year who have disabilities and chronic illnesses. Even though the agencies are separate, they work hand-in-hand to improve the quality of life for people who have disabilities, said Leslie Uriss-Spehar, the Woodlands' communications director. The Spina Bifida Association manages day-to-day operations at Fithian House, which sits on a small parcel of land it bought from the Woodlands. The new 14-unit apartment building was built for low-income people with disabilities who meet certain criteria. The association started accepting applications for the units in September and about 12 people are on a waiting list for an apartment, Mr. Lynch said. He said there are plans to build another similar apartment building next door to Fithian House. The association probably will apply for Housing and Urban Development financing this summer, he added. Mr. Lynch said the need for another apartment building is clear given the success of Fithian House. The one-bedroom units have kitchens and bathrooms. Even though 24-hour on-site care is not available, residents have access to staff working just yards away at the Gatehouse, a transitional-living facility, where 11 people with disabilities can live for up to two years, learning life and job skills so they can live independently. The association paid for Fithian House with a $2.1 million HUD grant and $350,000 from the Allegheny County Multi-Housing Division, with the remaining amount contributed by the association. The Fithian House took about three years from concept to completion, Mr. Lynch said. The man for whom the building is named volunteered regularly at The Woodlands and was on the board of directors for The Woodlands and the Spina Bifida Association of Western Pennsylvania. Mr. Fithian died in September. Although the apartment building is full, work continues, Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. Before the end of the month, surveyors will look over land that the Woodlands wants to make into a 6-foot-wide accessible and graded trail leading from Fithian House to the main campus, Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. The trail, which is expected to be done by fall, will be for both Fithian House and Gatehouse residents, she added. The Woodlands also is coordinating a volunteer day when FedEx Ground employees will take Fithian House residents shopping to outfit their apartments. At the same time, other FedEx employees will shop to equip the apartment building's common kitchen, while others will shop for food and cook dinner. At the end of the day, the employees and residents will sit down and eat the meal together, Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. \"Our mission is to enrich the lives of people with disabilities, and partnering with FedEx Ground to help the new residents of Fithian House is a fun and unique way for us to do this,\" Ms. Uriss-Spehar said. \"Our staff, as well as the volunteers, are really looking forward to it.\" Applications from those who want to live at Fithian House are screened by a committee using HUD guidelines. Ms. Uriss-Spehar said the process is anonymous so no one gets special preference.

The city's Stadium Authority board unanimously agreed yesterday with a Columbus developer's request to extend construction deadlines for North Shore hotel and amphitheater projects, though the request provoked warnings from board members. Continental Real Estate won approvals yesterday to push back construction starting dates for a $25 million Hyatt Place hotel until June 30 and a $12 million entertainment complex until Aug. 1. Under previous agreements with the authority, which controls the city-owned land between the North Shore stadiums, the developers were supposed to begin building next month. They requested more time to secure financing and government approvals for the projects, authority staffers said. Representatives from a union-backed neighborhood group called North Side United -- which has been trying to negotiate a community benefits agreement with Continental -- criticized the city agency for repeatedly siding with the developers. North Side United and Continental have not met since May 2008, organizers said. \"You're not acting in the public's interest -- you're acting in their interest,\" complained John Canning of the Central North Side. Though the board voted 5-0 to approve Continental's contract extensions, board members signaled some frustration and questioned whether the developers could finish the entertainment complex as promised by May 1, 2010. \"If this [approval] is given, we expect them to complete by the date we agreed to,\" state Rep. Jake Wheatley said. Continental \"better get on the stick, because we're kind of running out of patience. This is getting a little old for us,\" said the board's vice chair, Robert Ewanco. Stadium Authority Director Mary Conturo said it is possible for the developers to complete the amphitheater project in the nine months projected, from August to May 1, 2010. \"It's a tight schedule of course, but could be done,\" she said.

The hauntingly joyous strains of klezmer music from the Ortner-Roberts Duo filled the Shadyside Giant Eagle Market District yesterday afternoon, guiding Jewish shoppers to an area where they could get all of their Passover questions answered, pick up recipes and a free box of matzo. Volunteers in \"Got matzah?\" T-shirts handed children bags containing kits to make a colorful matzo covers for the Passover Seder meal, and games such as a Hebrew word search. Allison Grodin of Squirrel Hill brought her four young children because she wanted them to get excited about the upcoming holiday. Her eldest, Harrison, 8, held a paper plate with four small cups containing symbolic foods. \"It's a seder plate. I think this is neat,\" he said, pointing out the haroset -- a sweet mixture of nuts and fruit -- bitter herbs, greens and matzo. Eighteen Jewish organizations partnered with Giant Eagle at the Market Districts in Shadyside and Bethel Park for the third annual Passover in the Aisles. The eight-day holiday begins at sundown April 8. Jewish families will share a ritual meal that tells the story of the ancient Israelites' flight from slavery in Egypt. One of the most important rules is that, because the Israelites had no time to allow bread to rise, only unleavened bread -- matzo -- may be eaten during Passover. To ensure this, Jews traditionally rid their homes of anything containing yeast or other ingredients that rise when cooked. Beer, pasta and beans are all out. Rabbi Sharyn Henry, associate rabbi at Rodef Shalom Congregation in Oakland, fielded a question about whether soy sauce is kosher for Passover. It's not, \"because soy sauce has wheat in it,\" she said. The Reform rabbi stood near an \"Ask the Rabbi\" sign, along with rabbis from other traditions. Orthodox Rabbi Daniel Wasserman of Shaare Torah Congregation, Squirrel Hill, said that people often stop him in the supermarket to ask questions about what's kosher, especially at Passover. \"People get very nervous, and rightly so, because everything is different,\" he said. While correct observance is important, so is fun, he said. The Seder, which includes games such as hiding a piece of matzo, is intended to interest adults and children alike. \"At our seder there are very deep, intellectual discussions, but we also throw marshmallows to represent the plague of hail,\" he said, referring to one of 10 plagues that the Bible says God brought on the Egyptians. Passover in the Aisles began three years ago as an outreach to Jews who weren't involved with Jewish communal life. But it has other benefits, said Jeff Finkelstein, president and CEO of the United Jewish Federation, which initiated the project. \"It shows pride in being Jewish that we do something like this publicly,\" he said. \"And it brings together a wide variety of Jewish organizations. Some of the participants have very different beliefs than others, but they have all come together for this as a community. This is a way of showing that we have more in common than not in common.\" Rabbi Mordy Rudolph of Chabad-Shadyside belongs to a movement that is highly traditional, but he enjoys working alongside Reform rabbis. \"There are very few cities where the entire Jewish community can come together like this,\" he said. As he spoke, chefs in the Market District kitchen demonstrated Passover recipes. Tammy Berkowitz, owner of Sweet Tammy's kosher bakery in Squirrel Hill, prepared coconut macaroons, a Passover favorite. Although her bakery also makes a flourless chocolate cake, it closes for the eight-day holiday because she has no way to remove every trace of flour, yeast and other forbidden foods. Her macaroons are dipped in Passover chocolate, which contains no corn products because \"corn grows when you cook it,\" she said. Clarice Horne of Shadyside, has favorite Passover recipes that she has used for decades, including a matzo kugel -- a sweet casserole-like dish that is ordinarily made with noodles. \"But you can always try something new,\" she said as she picked up a free recipe booklet. \"It's fun to cook for Passover.\" Irv Younger, center, of Or L'Simcha, and Joe Jolson, right, of Beth Shalom Congregation, restock free matzo samples as fast as shoppers snapped them up at the Giant Eagle Market District store yesterday in Shadyside.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Shadyside", "latitude": 40.4515, "longitude": -79.9409}, {"name": "Squirrel Hill", "latitude": 40.4381, "longitude": -79.9192}, {"name": "Shadyside", "latitude": 40.4515, "longitude": -79.9409}, {"name": "Bethel Park", "latitude": 40.3276, "longitude": -80.0395}, {"name": "Egypt", "latitude": 27.0, "longitude": 30.0}, {"name": "Oakland", "latitude": 40.442, "longitude": -79.9626}, {"name": "Squirrel Hill", "latitude": 40.4381, "longitude": -79.9192}, {"name": "Egyptians", "latitude": 27.0, "longitude": 30.0}, {"name": "Shadyside", "latitude": 40.4515, "longitude": -79.9409}, {"name": "Squirrel Hill", "latitude": 40.4381, "longitude": -79.9192}, {"name": "Shadyside", "latitude": 40.4515, "longitude": -79.9409}, {"name": "Shadyside", "latitude": 40.4515, "longitude": -79.9409}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Standard poodle Hillwood Dassin De-Lovely took the winner's stage and posed regally for her victory photo after capturing the Best in Show award at yesterday's session of the Western Pennsylvania Kennel Association Dog Show. It makes sense that the pose would come naturally to the 3-year-old poodle who answers to the name \"Sissy,\" since it was the 13th best in show award she's garnered in the past year. \"It's very exciting every single time\" said Joseph Vergnetti, of Medina, Ohio, Sissy's handler and one of her owners. \"Today there were at least 1,000 dogs here and we beat out all of the others.\" Sissy competed in Saturday's session of the show, held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, but didn't make it to the final round. On Saturday, she took third place in her group, non-sporting breeds. To make it to the final round, a dog must place first in its group. Saturday's best in show went to an Airedale terrier, Stirling Cool Hand Luke. The best in show award came with a Waterford bowl, $100 and a ribbon. Over the course of the two-day event, about 2,500 dogs competed in the show, said Nance Shields, president of the Western Pennsylvania Kennel Association. While it came down to one top dog on the winner's stage by the end of the afternoon on Saturday and Sunday, the convention center hall was a whirl of activity in the morning and early afternoon as the owners and handlers of more the more than 1,000 dogs prepared them for competition. There was primping and brushing and teasing in all corners of the convention hall in preparation for contests what would give the dogs just a few minutes to strut their stuff. It's a familiar scene for many of the owners and handlers who spend their weekends traveling from dog show to dog show. Amy Booth, of Fowlerville, Mich., said she and her husband, Phil, will attend 150 to 180 dog shows this year. They traveled to this weekend's show in a box truck which they use to transport their dogs and all of the equipment needed for their travel and showing. They were able to get a hotel room that would permit their dogs at the Downtown Westin. When the weather gets warmer, the Booths and their dogs will travel to shows in their camper. One of the dogs the Booths entered into the competition yesterday was Ms. Booth's 2-year-old smooth fox terrier, Dodger. Even though he is a short-haired dog, Dodger's preparation included mousse and gel and powder to make his coat look good. It paid off -- Dodger was chosen as best in his breed and then placed second in the terrier group. \"I personally do it because I love the dogs. There is nothing better than traveling some place in the country and taking the dog with you and experiencing it with them,\" said Ms. Booth, a full-time breeder and dog handler. Kris Goodman of Hudson, Ohio, brought her Pyrenean shepherd, Conor, to yesterday's competition. \"He got beat, but that's OK,\" said Ms. Goodman, an industrial engineer for General Motors who said she travels to 30 to 50 dog shows a year. Ms. Goodman travels to many of the shows with her friend, Karen Mlynar, of Akron, Ohio. They transport their dogs and equipment in the back of a minivan. \"You do it because you love to do it. You love showing the dogs and the thrill of the win if you get it,\" she said. \"It's an addiction. I did it for 30 years,\" said Joy Kealy, publicity chairperson for the Western Pennsylvania Kennel Association. \"You are just so proud of your dog and you like to go out and meet up with your friends and have a nice weekend.\" Mary Brazytis, of Cleveland, brought her rescue dog, an English cocker spaniel named Moose, to compete in the obedience portion of the show. Moose started to compete about four years ago after a trainer told Ms. Brazytis that her dog \"would never amount to anything\" because he performed poorly in obedience class. \"I wanted to prove her wrong and show her that Moose could do something,\" she said, adding that Moose has also completed training to be a therapy dog. Julia Kinsey, of Canton, Ohio, was preparing her two white standard poodles -- Vegas and Trouble -- for their trip home yesterday after both were eliminated from the final rounds of the competition. The process, which included brushing the hairspray and other products from their puffy fur and wrapping their ears in plastic, took almost as long as preparing them for competition. Ms. Kinsey said she attends dog shows nearly every weekend and has done so for the past eight to 10 years. \"I spend way more time on their hair than I do on mine,\" she said.

David Eggert Associated Press March 23, 2009 From Lansing State Journal Lansing Board of Water & Light's commissioners may vote on a 2.5 percent rate increase at their meeting at 5:30 p.m. Thursday. It will be held at the BWL boardroom, 1232 Haco Drive. Last spring, the BWL's electric and water customers began paying 7 percent more. Steam customers had a 6 percent increase. - Lansing State Journal Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy distribute power to nearly 90 percent of Michigan's electric customers. The companies are seeking rate increases. Consumers Energy said its average residential power customer pays $89 a month. The bill would rise to $99, an 11 percent increase, under the company's proposal. Edison said a residential customer using 500 kilowatt hours a month pays $63. The bill would increase to about $70, an 11 percent increase, under the company's plan. Under a new state law, Consumers Energy could automatically implement its rate hike - or a lesser rate hike - in May if state regulators do not rule by then. Edison could do the same in July. Customers could get refunds, however, if the Michigan Public Service Commission later decides the increases are too high. Both utilities say they will make a decision on how to proceed as they get closer to the dates they can raise rates on their own - six months after a proposal is submitted. \"I think it is crummy in this time of hardship,\" said Bonnie Banks, 61, a retired court recorder who splits her time between Ann Arbor and Oscoda and is a power customer of both Consumers Energy and Edison. \"Because of the economy and all the layoffs and our high unemployment rate, it seems like there would be an even larger hardship for people.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Mich.", "latitude": 44.2503, "longitude": -85.5003}, {"name": "Lansing", "latitude": 42.7325, "longitude": -84.5555}, {"name": "Michigan", "latitude": 44.2503, "longitude": -85.5003}, {"name": "Michigan", "latitude": 44.2503, "longitude": -85.5003}, {"name": "Ann Arbor", "latitude": 42.2776, "longitude": -83.7409}, {"name": "Oscoda", "latitude": 44.4203, "longitude": -83.3308}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Wilder's unit had seven wrecks from 2005 to'08 Richmond police officers blamed for three crashes but charged in none At 1:40 a.m. on a Thursday last October, a 2006 Mercury crashed into a deer on state Route 5 in Charles City County. The wreck caused $1,713 in damage to the car's front end but no injuries to its occupants. It's an accident that typically would get little notice, except it involved a Richmond Police Department unit assigned to provide 24-hour security to then-Mayor L. Douglas Wilder. It was one of seven, mostly minor wrecks involving vehicles of the executive-protection unit since it was established in 2005, according to police records released under a Virginia Freedom of Information Act request. The Charles City crash occurred Oct. 16 at Route 5 and Adkins Road, about 12 miles northwest of Wilder's estate on the James River. Wilder lived there before he moved back to Richmond to meet residency requirements to be mayor. Assessment records show he still owns the property. Of the seven wrecks, city officers were blamed for three but charged in none, according to police reports and Charles City Sheriff Javier J. Smith. Other drivers were faulted in three wrecks and charged in at least two. One driver was cited with an improper lane change and another with failure to yield and driving without a license. Typically, city police officers aren't charged in minor wrecks because \"internal discipline procedures generally carry greater consequences to the officers than the citation would,\" Victoria N. Pearson, general counsel for the police department, said in an e-mail. \"Additionally, all of our accidents are reviewed by a review board, which includes citizens who participate in the process of determining appropriate discipline.\" Citing confidential personnel issues, Pearson would not say whether any officers had been disciplined. The accident reports describe officers' vehicles bumping into the back of one car, sideswiping another, and hitting the bumper of yet another. Except for the one in Charles City, all the wrecks occurred in Richmond. Damage estimates ranged from $50 to $4,000 per incident and more than $12,000 overall. The most expensive wreck caused by a city officer cost $1,822, according to the police department. The wrecks happened from June 2005 to October 2008, before Dwight C. Jones took office in January and ordered cuts of at least 50 percents to the unit's staff and fleet. The wreck in Charles City wasn't significant enough to warrant a full report, and no charges were filed, Sheriff Smith said.

A fireball and big boom that people witnessed Sunday night could have been caused by a meteor or even a falling part from a Russian spacecraft, experts say. \"I know it's one of the two,\" said Geoff Chester, an astronomer and public relations officer with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. \"I just can't tell you definitively which one it actually was.\" People in parts of Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina reported a light similar to fireworks about 9:40 p.m., followed by an explosive sound. Chester suggested that a falling Russian booster rocket caused the hubbub. The booster -- a steel cylinder about 25 feet long and 8 feet wide -- was part of the Soyuz spacecraft that launched Thursday on a mission to the International Space Station. The booster was expected to fall toward Earth on a path, headed east, that would have taken it across the Chesapeake Bay region Sunday night, Chester said. The booster would have burned in the friction of the Earth's atmosphere and, as it slowed below the speed of sound, it would have released energy that caused a sonic boom, Chester said. \"My feeling is this is what people actually saw,\" Chester said. Stefan Bocchino, a spokesman for the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, said experts there do not think the light was caused by a manmade object. The Joint Space Operations Center tracks manmade objects that enter the atmosphere. The National Weather Service has ruled out any weather-related cause. Other experts said the light and boom sound like the work of a meteor. Meteors are bits of space rock or gravel that burn and create light when they hit the atmosphere. \"Some very bright ones are known to explode,\" creating a sound, said Phillip Ianna, a professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Virginia. Meteors typically burn up in the atmosphere. Much less often, a small piece of the rock will hit Earth. Steve Chesley, an astronomer with NASA, said the Sunday phenomenon could be the work of a meteor the size of a television set or small car. \"These kinds of things hit the [atmosphere] once a month,\" Chesley said. They usually fall over water or less-populated areas and attract less attention. NASA doesn't track such small objects, Chesley said, and focuses instead on big ones -- space rocks half the length of a football field or more -- that are headed toward Earth. \"It's the big ones we're worried about, and we need to find them decades in advance,\" Chesley said. The object on Sunday had to be unusually bright to be seen in urban areas, where artificial lights drown out most celestial objects, said David Hagan, a staff scientist with the Science Museum of Virginia. \"It had to be quite a phenomenon to be observed from Shockoe Bottom,\" Hagan said. Brian Munford, 43, of Richmond, was driving in Short Pump when he saw the light. \"It was like a Roman candle headed the wrong way, coming down. . . . It was pretty cool-looking.\" Chester, of the Naval Observatory, said objects burning in the sky can appear deceptively close when they actually are many miles away.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Russian", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Washington", "latitude": 38.8951, "longitude": -77.0364}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Maryland", "latitude": 39.0004, "longitude": -76.75}, {"name": "North Carolina", "latitude": 35.5007, "longitude": -80.0003}, {"name": "Russian", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Earth", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Chesapeake Bay", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Earth", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "California", "latitude": 37.2502, "longitude": -119.751}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Earth", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Earth", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Shockoe Bottom", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Richmond", "latitude": 37.5538, "longitude": -77.4603}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

MANASSAS -- A Woodbridge man charged in the abduction and death of an Alexandria woman has been declared incompetent to stand trial and is awaiting treatment at a state mental-health hospital. Keith Baskerville -- the only survivor in the Sept. 13 event -- is charged with felony murder, abduction and carjacking charges in the death of 60-year-old Barbara Bosworth. This month, a judge in Prince William County Circuit Court declared Baskerville incompetent to stand trial and ordered him sent to Western State Hospital for treatment. Baskerville appeared in court Friday, when a judge was scheduled to review his case. But his review was continued after attorneys and the judge said Baskerville had not yet received the mental-health treatment ordered by the court. Baskerville is now due back in court April 24, when a judge will review his competency. Police said Baskerville and another man, 19-year-old Lutchman Chandler, abducted Bosworth from Springfield Mall in September and drove her to a PDQ Mart in Woodbridge, where they tried to use her ATM card to withdraw money. The men then left the store with Bosworth and crashed their car while fleeing the area. Chandler, who police said was driving the car at the time of the wreck, later died from his injuries. Judge Mary Grace O'Brien of Prince William Circuit Court said Baskerville's mental-health treatment had been delayed because she ordered him sent to Western State Hospital, though because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, state laws require that he be sent to Central State Hospital.

Derek D. Moore, a key figure in a plan hatched by York County high school friends last year to rob a notorious drug dealer, is getting a taste of life behind bars. Judge Thomas B. Hoover of New Kent County Circuit Court revoked bond and sent the former Bruton High School student to jail yesterday after Moore pleaded guilty in the case and then tested positive for marijuana. Also, two other defendants in the case were sentenced yesterday. Out on bond since shortly after his arrest in October, Moore, 19, told the judge at first that he was clean, but after testing positive, offered that he may have picked up marijuana in his system from being with friends. That excuse reverberates through a case that ended with the shooting death of another Bruton student, Christopher Greene, in the Oct. 14 effort to rob John Steven Carter of drugs and guns at Carter's Lanexa home. Carter, 56, was using an alias and was on the run from drug charges in Florida; he apparently gunned down Greene as Greene broke through Carter's back door with a rifle, according to court documents. Carter disappeared but was arrested this month in Alabama after a monthslong search. He is facing drug, weapon and fugitive charges in Florida; it is uncertain whether he will be extradited back to Virginia. Moore, who helped arrange the plan to rob Carter and who drove to Lanexa on Oct. 14 with three other current or former Bruton students, lost his freedom yesterday and will be formally sentenced June 8. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and attempted robbery; sentencing guidelines indicate he'll serve seven to 20 months in jail. Moore was best friends with Greene and came forward to police the day after Greene's death. \"What we know about this case comes from Mr. Moore,\" Commonwealth's Attorney C. Linwood Gregory told Hoover. Two other defendants in the case pleaded guilty yesterday to misdemeanor charges of being accessories to conspiracy and to attempted robbery. Robert T. Tynes Jr., described in a batch of letters of support as an outstanding young man with a limitless future, received a suspended 24-month sentence. Tynes accompanied others to Lanexa and drove the vehicle home that carried the young men, leaving Greene's body behind outside Carter's back door. A third defendant, Kodie L. Tyler, who passed up bond and has been in jail since October, received a 10-year sentence, with all but six months suspended. He pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy to commit grand larceny. The drug den operated by Carter housed a secret marijuana growing operation. Two 18-year-old acquaintances of Moore set the robbery in motion by telling him about Carter; Robert M. Perez drove Moore and Greene to Lanexa to check out the house the day before the robbery attempt. John W. Chaffin and Perez told Moore he could find \"pillowcases full\" of dope at Carter's, and a deal was struck to share proceeds of the heist. This month, Chaffin and Perez pleaded guilty to attempted petit larceny. Perez received a suspended 12-month sentence and Chaffin is serving six months. Chaffin was sent directly to jail after testing positive for cocaine.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "York County", "latitude": 37.2335, "longitude": -76.5497}, {"name": "York County", "latitude": 37.2335, "longitude": -76.5497}, {"name": "New Kent County", "latitude": 37.4835, "longitude": -76.9997}, {"name": "Lanexa", "latitude": 37.4238, "longitude": -76.9011}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Alabama", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -86.7503}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.7505, "longitude": -82.5001}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5481, "longitude": -77.4467}, {"name": "Lanexa", "latitude": 37.4238, "longitude": -76.9011}, {"name": "Lanexa", "latitude": 37.4238, "longitude": -76.9011}, {"name": "Lanexa", "latitude": 37.4238, "longitude": -76.9011}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) \u0097 The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is cracking down on out-of-state boaters who do not pay Indiana excise taxes. More than 300 people with boats moored in Hammond and East Chicago have been fined for failing to pay the tax. As many as 89 people could face fines of $500 and have their driver's licenses suspended for not acting on the tickets. Out-of-state residents can register their boats in their home state, but must pay Indiana excise taxes if they boat in Indiana. The recent crackdown was prompted in part by complaints by angry Indiana residents who pay the state's excise tax when they register their boats. ``These people felt they were being cheated,'' said DNR Lt. Jerry Shepherd. At the large Hammond Marina, about 85 percent of boaters live outside of Indiana. Port Authority Director Milan Kruszynski said ticketed boaters weren't happy, especially since they have to travel to Lowell Town Court if they want to contest the ticket. Of the more than 300 boaters cited in Hammond and East Chicago, between 150 and 200 refused to comply, contested or did not respond to the notice, said DNR Public Information Officer Shawn Brown. The Indiana General Assembly passed a law in 2006 to allow greater enforcement of the state's excise tax.

The biggest challenge may not be finding a park in Chesterfield County, but finding a hillside worthy of a sled. The winter storm has not been a long overdue play date for everyone.

When author Bracelen Flood speaks, he rarely has a Lincoln impersonator to use as a prop. However, as the author addressed a crowd of more than 220 Wednesday evening in the Grand Reading Room of Eastern Kentucky University\u2019s library, Flood called upon living history portrayer Bob Coffey to illustrate a scene depicted in his latest book, \u201c1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History.\u201d When the 12,000-man force of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early threatened the capital, coming to within five miles of the White House, Lincoln visited the capital\u2019s defenders at Fort Stevens, about five miles from the White House. Climbing upon the fort\u2019s parapet, the 6-foot, 4-inch Lincoln, wearing his trademark stovepipe hat, presented a 7-foot silhouette at which Confederate snipers could aim. To illustrate, Flood asked Coffey to stand. The Rockcastle County resident is the same height as Lincoln and almost the same age as the president was in 1864. Wearing a stovepipe hat, Coffey appeared giant-like to the audience. In contrast, the average Union soldier\u2019s height was only 5 feet, 6 inches. Lincoln probably is the only U.S. president to come under war-time fire while in office, Flood said. Captured Confederates later said their snipers recognized Lincoln\u2019s unmistakable profile, but all of their bullets missed the president who would be felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet the following year after the soldiers\u2019 guns had fallen silent. Lincoln lived long enough, however, to stiffen the nation\u2019s resolve in the face of military disasters, win re-election and see the Union to victory, Flood said. \u201cHow did Lincoln get his reputation for honesty?\u201d a questioner asked after Flood\u2019s address. Alluding to scandals of the past 35 years that have sent three Illinois governors to prison and led to another\u2019s indictment and impeachment, \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard for an Illinois politician to acquire a reputation for honesty,\u201d Flood said to much laughter. An elementary school student asked Flood what he found most interesting about Lincoln. The president set aside three hours every day for citizens to meet him in his office, Flood said. \u201cHe would see about 50 people each day in the order they arrived, regardless of who they were,\u201d the author said. Lincoln also had every letter sent to him answered, and penned a few answers himself. Those gestures allowed visitors from all over the country, even from as far as California, to see \u201cThere was a real person in the White House who care about them,\u201d Flood said. That helped stiffened the nation\u2019s spine when many in the North were ready to give up on the war, he said. Flood\u2019s presentation took place in the library where he has researched four books over the past 35 years. \u201cI am (in the Library) so much of the time that I regard the staff as my friends,\u201d Flood wrote in the acknowledgments of the Lincoln book. The nationally acclaimed writer has worked in some of the nation\u2019s largest and most prestigious libraries, including the Library of Congress, the Harvard University library and the New York Public Library. \u201cWhat I have (at EKU) makes me competitive with people working in any university or large public library anywhere in the country,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in a room at New York Public Library reserved for writers, called the Frederick Lewis Allen Writers\u2019 Room,\u201d the Manhattan native and Harvard graduate said. \u201cI can tell you what I have (at EKU) works better for me than what I had at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue (in New York City).\u201d To express his gratitude to the library, Flood said he agreed to serve as president of the Friends of the EKU Libraries in 2006-08. \u201cHe was the leader who spearheaded the revitalization of the group,\u201d said Carrie Cooper, dean of EKU\u2019s libraries. \u201cWe began with a handful of supporters from years past and now have nearly 200 members of our friends group thanks to Bracelen\u2019s leadership.\u201d Cooper said her staff feels privileged to assist a writer of Flood\u2019s caliber and is inspired his dedication to his work. \u201cHe is in the library many days as soon as the doors open and often doesn\u2019t leave until late into the evening,\u201d she said. \u201cHe eats lunch with our staff, celebrates their achievements, both personally and professionally, and has made many dear friends within our organization.\u201d Co-sponsored by the Friends of Madison County Public Library and Friends of the EKU Libraries, Wednesday\u2019s event also featured an exhibit of Civil War documents, including a Lincoln letter from the university\u2019s archives, a pass the president signed for a Kentucky civilian to go through Union lines at Louisville and a parole for a Union soldier and member of the Kentucky Home Guard who was captured at the Battle of Richmond.

It will not be just any garden, however. \u201cThis will a rain garden, designed and constructed to decrease and filter storm water runoff,\u201d said Tammy Ritchison, the club\u2019s parent co-sponsor. The garden will be planted only with native plants that put down deep roots, making them drought resistant and enhancing the garden\u2019s filtration capabilities. Rain gardens are planted in depressions, dug about 10 to 18 inches below the surrounding surface, Ritchison said. \u201cThat allows them to capture storm runoff,\u201d she said. Water stands no more than two days in a rain garden because a mixture of organic material and/or sand is added to allow drainage. Scott Darst, Madison County extension agent for youth development, visited Kit Carson Elementary on Wednesday to help club members conduct a soil percolation test, to determine how their rain garden\u2019s soil should be treated to ensure drainage. If properly designed and constructed, a rain garden will capture 90 percent of the precipitation dropped by a typical Kentucky rain. \u201cSome people fear that mosquitoes will lay eggs in the water collected by a rain garden,\u201d Ritchison said. \u201cMosquitoes will lay eggs in the water, but the eggs do not hatch for seven days. Because the rain garden pools drain in two days, the mosquito eggs die. That actually helps reduce the mosquito population.\u201d The native wildflowers and grasses prescribed for a rain garden not only are beautiful, the seeds they produce attract birds that eat mosquitoes and other pests, she said. One plant native to Kentucky, the butterfly milkweed, will attract monarch butterflies to a rain garden, because the milkweed is the only plant in which the large orange and black butterfly lays its eggs. The students will plant their garden on Earth Day, April 22. The project is being funded with by a $500 grant from the Bluegrass Rain Garden Alliance. Ecology club members raised an additional $650 by selling candygrams for Valentine\u2019s Day, Ritchison said. The school\u2019s ecology club, which started three years ago with eight members, today includes more than 75 students from third through fifth grades. Teachers Vivian Bowles and Stacey Wills are the faculty co-sponsors.

The mother suffered head and leg injuries and was transported to Pattie A. Clay Regional Medical Center, Reardon said. The severity of her injuries is unknown. The infant and the father were uninjured in the crash, which slowed traffic along the interstate for 30 to 45 minutes. King was lodged in the Madison County Detention Center following the accident. He is free on a $5,000 cash bond, jail officials said Monday. City tools takenA thief stole more than $2,600 in tools from the City of Richmond\u2019s public works department Friday. Employees at the department\u2019s E. Walnut Street offices discovered Friday morning that someone had used an office window to break into the building and made off with a number of tools, Reardon said. Missing are three Stihl chainsaws, three bull floats, five bull float handles, a Milwaukee brand hammer drill, a power post-hole digger, an auger and a handheld Stihl concrete saw, all valued at $2,681. The thief also damaged a Pepsi vending machine while attempting to break into it, Reardon said. Other crimes Two leaf blowers were reported stolen Friday by the owner of Silver Cliff Landscaping. The backpack-style Stihl blowers were taken from a truck being used at St. Andrews Retirement Community and were valued at $1,000. More than $2,500 in electronics were reported stolen Monday morning from an apartment in the 100 block of O\u2019Roark Avenue. The residents told police someone had cut the screen from the storm door and manipulated the lock during the early morning hours to break into the home. Missing were a Sony PlayStation 3, an XBox 360, games for both systems, 60 to 70 DVDs and two Dell Inspiron laptop computers. The items were valued at $2,550. A Louisiana man was arrested for carrying a concealed deadly weapon Sunday following a traffic stop near the Eastern Bypass. Sean Clouthier, 22, of Sulpher, La., was stopped at the intersection of Lancaster Avenue and the Eastern Bypass for a traffic stop, and a search of his vehicle uncovered a loaded 9mm pistol and a loaded .45-caliber pistol in the vehicle\u2019s console. A wallet was reported stolen Saturday from an unlocked car parked outside the Pink Flamingo Laundromat on Big Hill Avenue. The wallet was later recovered near Advance Auto Parts, but $108 in cash had been taken. Gabriel Shearer, 34, of Richmond, was arrested Saturday for misdemeanor theft by unlawful taking after Walmart employees detained him for allegedly taking $33 in merchandise from the store.

Since the two-week old service came into effect Hounslow Labour councillors revealed they have been repeatedly contacted by unhappy residents. Complaints have included the non-collection of recycling, non-delivery and loss of containers and emptied containers strewn across garden paths and pavements. Brentford ward councillor Ruth Cadbury said: \u201cThe numbers of complaints have rocketed and this means that people will be put off recycling. \u201cThis is terrible news for the environment, and will cost our council tax payers money as more waste goes to land-fill.\u201d At the time the council said it believed the system, which saw new containers for paper, plastic and food waste being dropped off at homes in the borough, would make it easier for residents to recycle more of their household waste. Hounslow\u2019s lead member for environment and planning, Councillor Barbara Reid, apologised this week for the failures of the service and said that she was taking the problem very seriously.

Dziekanski died after he was shocked several times by a Taser wielded by RCMP Const. Kwesi Millington, one of four airport police who said Dziekanski was hit with the high-voltage electrical stun gun because he was acting in a threatening manner. Following the incident, the RCMP asked the Delta Police Department\u2019s firearms expert Const. Craig Baltzer to examine the Taser that was fired at Dziekanski by Millington. Baltzer downloaded information from a computer chip that is included with each Taser designed to record every discharge of the device. The constable will give evidence about his findings when the public inquiry chaired by Thomas Braidwood resumes on March 23. The Delta officer is expected to take the stand some time after RCMP Cpl. Benjamin Robinson, one of the four airport officers and the supervisor on duty at the time Dziekanski died. Before the inquiry took a two-week break, it heard the RCMP officer who fired the Taser admit that he\u2019d made erroneous statements in his report about the deadly encounter. Millington originally stated that Dziekanski had to be repeatedly shocked because he didn\u2019t immediately fall to the ground. But a video taken by a witness shows that Dziekanski did fall to the ground when stunned.

He also said he didn\u2019t issue a warning to Dziekanski that he was going to use the Taser because he felt he didn\u2019t have time and that Dziekanski, who was holding a stapler, was posing a threat to himself and the other officers.

After enduring the coldest winter in 16 years and now persistent below-normal temperatures that are chilling what should be spring, Richmondites can be excused for asking what gives. Meteorologists suspect coastal B.C. is now being nipped by a trend of colder than normal winter temperatures that could last a decade. Or two. Or three. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a phenomenon of alternating phases in which offshore ocean temperatures tend to run warmer and then colder\u2014for 20 to 30 years at a stretch. \u201cThere\u2019s some debate as to whether we\u2019ve slipped into a cold phase or not,\u201d said Environment Canada meteorologist Gabor Fricska. \u201cIt may be too early to say definitively.\u201d A warm Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase was measured from 1920-1945 followed by a cold phase that lasted until 1975, bringing the Lower Mainland many severe winters. Since then it\u2019s been a mixed bag: three cold years until 2002, then four more warmer years. But Fricska says some meteorologists think the recent spate of cold weather may be the onset of a new cold phase. \u201cIt is cold right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sea surface temperatures immediately off of our coast are one to two degrees below normal.\u201d Three out of the last four seasons (except last fall) have been colder than seasonal, he added. When a cold Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase is prevalent, winter low pressure systems in the Gulf of Alaska are often weaker than usual, allowing more cold air to come down to the coast from northern B.C. For anyone wanting proof of the hardship endured in the winter of 2008-09, Fricska offers these Metro Vancouver stats for December-January-February, from the airport weather station: It was the coldest winter since 1992-93 and the 10th coldest since record keeping began in 1937. Mean temperatures for the three months averaged 2.4 C, down from a normal of 3.6 degrees. Snowfall was more than two and a half times normal\u2014109 cms versus 42.5\u2014while rainfall was 35 per cent below normal. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t imagining things if they think it\u2019s colder,\u201d Fricska said. How could this be happening in an era of global warming? Fricska said Pacific Decadal Oscillations and shorter duration weather variations like El Nino are regional shifts that don\u2019t reflect what\u2019s happening at the planetary level. He noted B.C. experienced many of its coldest winters in recent memory during the cold oscillation cycle from 1945 to 1975\u2014even though global air temperatures climbed steadily during that period. Yet more snow fell this week at some higher elevations around the Lower Mainland. \u201cOur seasonal forecast for the spring is for continuing below normal temperatures on the coast,\u201d Fricska said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Richmondites", "latitude": 42.764, "longitude": -80.8447}, {"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -96.0}, {"name": "Lower Mainland", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Gulf of Alaska", "latitude": 59.0, "longitude": -145.0}, {"name": "Vancouver", "latitude": 49.2497, "longitude": -123.119}, {"name": "B.C.", "latitude": 53.9998, "longitude": -125.003}, {"name": "Lower Mainland", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s membership in the Council of Europe is not threatened by sanctions, despite Moscow\u2019s continued refusal to ratify two key human rights protocols, two of the council\u2019s top politicians said Wednesday. Luc van den Brande and Theodoros Pangalos, who monitor Russia\u2019s compliance with its commitments to the council, said talk of sanctions against Moscow was groundless and that they hoped that the State Duma would soon ratify the outstanding protocols. \u201cI do not like sanctions. It is important that Russia is not marginalized,\u201d van den Brande told reporters after two days of talks with government officials and Duma deputies. Russia has irked many in the 47-member council by being the only country that has not ratified two amendments to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 6 requires signatories to restrict the use of the death penalty to times of war. Protocol 14 stipulates reforms for the European Court of Human Rights. Pangalos, a former Greek foreign minister and Socialist member of parliament, complained that Russia\u2019s obstinacy was hampering the development of the whole council. He questioned arguments by Russian officials that public opinion was not ready for a formal abolition of capital punishment by pointing out that it was no longer carried out. \u201cWhy do you not apply it and at the same time say it is approved by the population?\u201d he asked. Russia has maintained a moratorium on the death penalty since 1996, when it joined the Council of Europe. Pangalos said the nonratification of the protocol for reforming the European Court of Human Rights was even stranger given that officials in the Justice Ministry told him that they were in favor of ratification. \u201cThe ball is in the field of the Duma,\u201d he said.

Generations of Russian artists who emigrated to the U.S. are on display at the Russian Museum. David Burliuk\u2019s \u2018Portrait of Professor Nicholas K. Roerich\u2019 (1929) is one of the items displayed. In David Burliuk\u2019s \u201cHudson,\u201d a view of the New York City skyline seems to fly apart into ribbons of image and memory like a fleeting dream. But for Burliuk and the other Russian emigre artists featured in a new exhibition at the Russian Museum, America was a tangible reality that strongly influenced the development of their art, as demonstrated by Burliuk\u2019s departure from his earlier work in \u201cHudson.\u201d The traveling exhibition, titled \u201cAmerican Artists from the Russian Empire,\u201d includes 45 artists who left Russia or the Soviet Union for America in the first half of the 20th century, and is the first time such a cast of artists has been assembled. \u201cSome go together, some don\u2019t,\u201d said Yevgenia Petrova, deputy director of the State Russian Museum and the project\u2019s main creative force. \u201cIt\u2019s a cross-section of what went on in Russian-American art up to the middle of the 20th century.\u201d This schizophrenic amalgam of paintings and sculptures runs the gamut from Neo-classicism to Abstract art and includes several generations of artists, from Cubo-futurist Max Weber to Alexander Liberman. The idea came from a 2003 exhibition of Russians who emigrated to France. The American-based Foundation for International Arts and Education organized the exhibition, drawing from museums, galleries and private collections in the U.S. The show made its debut at the Fred Jones Jr. Museum at the University of Oklahoma this spring, and will return to San Diego after a two-month run at Moscow\u2019s Tretyakov Gallery this summer. Its appearance in St. Petersburg marks the first time these works have been shown in Russia. \u201cFor the American public, the goal is to remind viewers that these artists had Russian roots, to point out what they brought from Russia to American art, and what from American art influenced them,\u201d Petrova said. In Russia, the exhibition aims to familiarize viewers with new art. \u201cFor [these artists], showing in Russia was impossible because of the Iron Curtain; it wasn\u2019t patriotic to show such work,\u201d Petrova said. American visitors will likely know artists like Mark Rothko, whose distinctive abstract style featuring solid blocks of color has become an icon of American art. Russian art-lovers, on the other hand, may know Boris Grigoryev, whose striking, slightly off-kilter portraits and depictions of peasant life have been extensively exhibited in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The first wave of Russian artists to move to America was mainly made up of Jews who left before the Bolshevik Revolution, seeking chances to exhibit and study art after suffering anti-Semitism in Russia. \u201cThey left to obtain an education and gain freedom,\u201d Petrova said. Life in the Jewish Pale denied these artists a chance to show their work or communicate with kindred spirits on the international art scene, she explained. After the revolution, many more artists fled in the face of violence, starvation and political persecution during the Civil War and under the Soviet regime. \u201cThey left \u2026 to avoid prison and stay alive, but also to keep working; they didn\u2019t want to take part in Socialist realism,\u201d Petrova said. Once in the United States, Russian artists were exposed to fluid, \u201ccontagious\u201d new influences that profoundly affected their work, Petrova said. \u201cThe Burliuk painting of New York is so unexpected for Burliuk, it shows how strongly American art influenced these artists,\u201d she said. At the same time, the Russian artists influenced their American counterparts and retained something distinctly Russian in their work. Petrova pointed to surrealist painter Pavel Tchelitchew, who is included in the exhibition, and how his overarching aesthetic resembled that of Pavel Filonov, who remained in Russia. Although the two men most likely didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s work, they arrived at similar ideas on \u201cwhat\u2019s close to man in nature\u201d thanks to a shared background in Russian natural philosophy, she said. Shannon and Julie Ward, visiting from Los Angeles, said the exhibition showcased the ties between Russian and American art. \u201cThere\u2019s really a lot of crossover; American artists looked like Russians and vice versa,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAmerican Artists from the Russian Empire\u201d runs through June at the State Russian Museum, 4 Inzhenernaya Ulitsa, M: Gostiny Dvor.

As the Week Against Homophobia gets underway in St. Petersburg and several other Russian cities, Wednesday\u2019s debates at Sochi music bar showed that gay rights activists have a long way to go to overcome the superstitions. One of the two participants, Mikhail Potepkin of the Kremlin-backed youth movement Nashi, who described himself as \u201chomonegativist,\u201d compared homosexuality to necrophilia and bestiality and said that as a member of a sexual majority, he has the right not to see gay people on Nevsky Prospekt, St. Petersburg\u2019s main street. Potepkin\u2019s supporters reacted by giggling and applauding his jokes, and in subsequent discussions in the blogosphere, his views were largely considered to be \u201cmoderate.\u201d But Valery Sozayev, chairman of the board of Vykhod (Coming Out), St. Petersburg\u2019s gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights organization that was founded last year, believes the discussion was useful. \u201cUnfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, we saw the true colors of the contemporary political scene as it is,\u201d Sozayev said by phone on Thursday. \u201cOur politicians cannot speak normally about violations of the rights of the LGBT community. For them, it is all either very funny or very scabrous, and we saw more evidence of this yesterday. But the fact that it was articulated, that it entered the public space, the space of public youth politics is already an achievement, because it would not have been possible even 12 months ago. \u201cWe are starting to come out, so the reaction will naturally be negative and tough on the part of homophobes, but we should be prepared for that. We merely see confirmation of the necessity of our work. The Week Against Homophobia is dedicated to the memory of victims of political repression. \u201cThe year of 2009 has been declared a year for remembering gays and lesbians who were the victims of political repression, because this year it will be 75 years since consensual same-sex relations between men became criminally punishable under the Soviet Criminal Code,\u201d Sozayev said. Similar events have been held in the city in the past, but this year, importantly, it is part of Xenophobii.NET, or the No to Xenophobia campaign, which was launched on March 15 and continues through Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting and positive that in St. Petersburg it has become part of the coalition and is held with the support of other public organizations, and this is for the first time,\u201d Sozayev said. \u201cMany public organizations, both human rights and political, have supported this event.\u201d Although Vykhod takes part in demonstrations such as last year\u2019s anti-Nazi March Against Hatred, Sozayev described his organization as \u201cnon-political.\u201d \u201cThe March Against Hatred is not a political march, it\u2019s a citizens\u2019 march, [but] we don\u2019t take part in and are not planning to take part in political events, because people who belong to the LGBT community have diverse political views, so we cannot maintain a specific political view. \u201cOur task is not to confront the authorities, but to help them to fulfill the obligations they took on for themselves.\u201d Last year, however, the gay community saw a clampdown by the St. Petersburg authorities. In October, Side by Side, St. Petersburg\u2019s first lesbian and gay film festival, had to take place in private after fire inspectors suddenly shut down the two venues due to host the event. Those venues had in turn been hurriedly booked after Pik Cinema mysteriously withdrew its support for the festival. Earlier in the year, gay clubs Central Station and Bunker were subject to police raids. \u201cI think that despite everything, we can cooperate with the authorities,\u201d Sozayev said. \u201cThe fact that some events are being held now and that the authorities are not putting any pressure on these events is also indicative of that, as well as the fact that our organization was officially registered with no problems [in January]. \u201cWe can\u2019t see what is on the authorities\u2019 mind, but some process is underway.\u201d", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "St. Petersburg", "latitude": 59.8944, "longitude": 30.2642}, {"name": "Russian", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": 100.0}, {"name": "Nevsky Prospekt", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "St. Petersburg", "latitude": 59.8944, "longitude": 30.2642}, {"name": "St. Petersburg", "latitude": 59.8944, "longitude": 30.2642}, {"name": "St. Petersburg", "latitude": 59.8944, "longitude": 30.2642}, {"name": "St. Petersburg", "latitude": 59.8944, "longitude": 30.2642}, {"name": "St. Petersburg", "latitude": 59.8944, "longitude": 30.2642}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Stewart Cusimano, who's been at the department for 29 years. \"That's what was really lacking here.\" Flores, 26, had just left the Army where he had served as a lieutenant during Operation Desert Storm. He had moved his wife and 8-month-old daughter, Danielle, to Santa Clara for a job at Applied Materials where he was to train for a few months before transferring to the company's Dallas office. \"He had paid his dues and put himself through college,'' said his mother, Ellen Mauro, from her home in Rhode Island, where Flores grew up. \"This was his big chance and he never got to enjoy it.\" In the 15 years since Flores' death, Mauro hounded the FBI, congressional leaders and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno for help in her son's case. She even sought out psychics. Nothing panned out. \"I spent more than five years going everywhere and anywhere to anyone who I thought could help,'' she said, \"and all I would get were doors slammed in my face or letters saying, 'We can't help you.' '' His widow, Denise, a nurse who lives in Massachusetts, never remarried and both she and Danielle always wonder why Flores' life was taken so brutally. \"We lived very ordinary lives,'' she said. \"There have been so many days and nights when I've thought of every possible scenario and nothing makes sense.\" Danielle knows her father only through videos and photographs, including one near the Golden Gate Bridge taken days before his death, where's he's holding her in his arms. Flores' case has appeared on \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" airing periodically over the years and occasionally generating new leads. \"We've probably spent more time on this case than any other case that I can recall,\" Cusimano said. More recently, Santa Clara police had consultants look at the case, submitted new evidence to the lab and reviewed the surveillance tape. Detectives also took a new look at his military connections, exploring his relationships and assignments. Flores had no known enemies, so there's a question whether it could have been a case of mistaken identity. \"There are no facts that can substantiate a theory,\" Cusimano said. The family, however, remains frustrated with police. Cusimano said he understands. \"I don't blame them. I'm frustrated. This is one of those cases that I have always taken a personal interest in.\" At Applied Materials, the executives who knew Flores are gone. His old boss, Gary Robertson, who found him in the parking lot that day, no longer wants to talk about the case. And, since Flores had been at the tech company just days, not many knew him. Still, a reminder of him lingers at the company's sprawling campus. There, near the dull forbidding concrete Building 12 on Oakmead Village Drive, is a scarcely noticeable barren tree planted in Flores' honor. Next to it lies a tombstone-like granite monument ensconced in a cluster of rocks with a plaque. It says simply: Matthew D. Flores, 1967-1994. Murder victim Matthew Flores was killed in 1994 in the Applied Materials parking lot. The case is still unsolved. This is Flores' ID badge for Applied Materials.

Not the woman who heard the shot and turned to see his kneeling body, slumped next to the driver's door of his sedan. Nor the other drivers who entered the parking lot just before he was shot once in the back of the head at point-blank range. None of the security cameras captured the shooting, and there was no shell casing from a weapon or sign of a struggle.

SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A fourth Oakland police officer who was shot by a 26-year-old man wanted on a parole violation has been taken off of life support, a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday. Officer John Hege was taken off life support Monday night, said Andrea Breaux of Alameda County Medical Center. The 41-year-old Concord resident's family had kept him alive so his organs could be donated, in keeping with his wishes. Breaux said the process of harvesting Hege's organs started just after 8 p.m. Monday and was completed by 2 a.m. today. According to police, Hege and a partner, Sgt. Mark Dunakin, were gunned down when they pulled over the parolee on Saturday. A massive manhunt ensued and two more officers died when the city's SWAT team stormed an apartment where the suspected gunman, Lovelle Mixon, was hiding. Mixon was fatally shot. The two officers who were killed at the apartment were Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35. \"This is the biggest tragedy ever to hit our department,\" Oakland police Sgt. Mark Schmid said Monday. \"We're just numb and walking around like zombies. We feel each other's pain but we don't know how to explain it.\" Flowers piled up outside Oakland police headquarters and books brimmed with condolences. A vigil was planned for Tuesday evening at the corner near where the two motorcycle officers pulled over Mixon. DNA found at the scene of the rape was a probable match to Lovelle Mixon, Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Monday night. Investigators got that information Friday, the day before the routine traffic stop ended in gunfire. California prison records show that authorities had issued a warrant for Mixon's arrest after he failed to make a mandatory meeting with his parole officer on Feb. 19. The family said he had previously served six years in state prison for assault with a firearm during an armed robbery in San Francisco. More recently, he had served several months in prison last year. State Attorney General Jerry Brown said he will examine how Mixon, 26, was monitored following his release from prison in November. Mixon also was a suspect in a murder but was never charged, according to state prison officials. \"Mixon was certainly a character that needed more supervision,\" said Brown, the former mayor of Oakland. \"In Oakland, the highway patrol has an office there, sheriff and police. And all those agencies should have a list of the more dangerous, threatening parolees so they can keep a watch on them.\" Problems involving parolees from California's overcrowded prison system have long beset state officials who must monitor them, local officials who try to keep streets safe and federal authorities who enforce firearms and other laws. Mixon was one of 164 Oakland parolees in mid-March who had outstanding arrest warrants for parole violations, state prison records show. The city of 400,000 had more than 1,900 total parolees at the time, including nearly 300 who had been returned to custody or whose parole was about to be revoked. During traffic stops, police often check vehicle records to find whether the driver has outstanding warrants. But police have not disclosed how Saturday's shooting unfolded. Mixon's family members said he was upset that he was unable to find work, felt his parole officer was not helping him and feared he would be arrested for a parole violation. State prison officials said Mixon's parole officer was responsible for 70 parolees. A caseload of that size is nearly unmanageable, and also not unusual, said Lance Corcoran, spokesman for California's prison guard union, which includes parole officers. \"There is no control,\" Corcoran said. \"It's simply supervision, and supervision at distance.\" Associated Press writers Josh Dubow, Lisa Leff and Juliana Barbassa in San Francisco and Terry Collins in Oakland contributed to this report.

The appeals court concluded that Earle's trial was tainted because Superior Court Judge Rene Navarro allowed the jury to consider a separate, unrelated misdemeanor indecent exposure charge, which was emphasized heavily by the prosecutor. The 6th District found that the evidence against Earle was weak and circumstantial in the more serious sexual assault case, and that trying the two allegations at the same time allowed prosecutors to exploit the indecent exposure evidence \"through spurious legal theories'' to convict Earle. The appellate panel ruled that Earle was entitled to separate trials on the two distinct charges. Justice Nathan Mihara dissented, saying trying the two charges together did not deprive Earle of a fair trial and did not prejudice the outcome.

Andrew Trapani is a gambling man. Rising from a West Valley College student to video game tester to Hollywood producer is a testament to Trapani's willingness to work hard and take risks. Those risks have paid off as Trapani's first major-release feature film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will open in theaters on March 27. But Trapani's story really begins about 20 years ago. Trapani rose quickly through the ranks in his five years with the company, going from game tester to designer and then ultimately to producer. The Saratoga native oversaw the development of some of the first Sony Playstation games, which was a transitioning period for video game developers as games went from cartridges to a CD format, which gave video games richer and more robust play, Trapani said. But one of the moments that steered the course of his career came in the late 1990s, when he produced a 30-minute movie-esque narrative for the video game, Solar Eclipse. Trapani and his crew spent three days shooting footage in Los Angeles. One day he and a peer were discussing what they would do if they won the lottery. Trapani said he would produce movies. After some thought, Trapani said he realized that he didn't have to win the lottery. So in March 1998 he resigned from his position and decided not long after to move to Los Angeles. \"I didn't have it all figured out, but I knew I wanted to do movies,\" he said. \"I always knew I wanted to do something that didn't require that I wear a suit every day.\" Within his first year in Los Angeles Trapani produced the independent film, \"True Rights,\" about a camera crew that chases down news events in hopes of locking up a movie deal. The movie was shot in 18 days on 35-millimeter film in what Trapani calls a \"run and gun, guerilla-style\" format. While in post-production on \"True Rights,\" Trapani received a call from someone he had worked with on the film, asking if he would be interested in producing commercials. Trapani said yes and spent a few months on commercial production. In 2000 Trapani founded Integrated Films, a production and management company, which has produced the movies Borderland, Tamara and the remake of Amityville Horror. But in a few days Trapani's latest film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will hit theaters across the nation, which will undoubtedly have much more exposure to a wider audience than any of his previous films. \"I'm really proud of it. I'm proud of everyone who contributed to it,\" he said. \"The Haunting\" is based on the true story of the Snedeker family, who moved into a Connecticut home back in the 1980s that had once been a mortuary. The story goes that the family was looking for an affordable place to live where their son, who was undergoing cancer treatment, could be closer to the hospital where he was receiving treatment. The family, not knowing the dark history of the home, began having unexplained things happen in their house. The movie stars Academy Award-nominated actress Virginia Madsen (\"Sideways\"). The idea to do this movie came to Trapani after he watched a 2003 documentary on the family on the Discovery Channel. He thought the story would make a great movie and contacted the family, eventually receiving the rights to make a feature film. Two years later Trapani was able to sell the movie to Gold Circle Films, an independent film production company, and the writers were able to begin putting together the script. \"At that point we were finally on our way to getting the movie made,\" Trapani said. The producer said that he knows that no matter how well this movie does, the mass audience will most likely never know who he is. And he says he is just fine with that. \"I didn't come to Los Angeles to be an actor,\" he said. \"Fame is not of interest to me.\" Instead, Trapani said he's much more interested in putting out quality films and having the respect of his peers. That's much more valuable to him, he says, and more in line with what he cares about. \"At the end of the day it's up to the producer to protect the integrity of the movie,\" he said. \"I just love movies. I understand them in a way that is a byproduct of what I was predisposed to do.\" Just as he's done with his career, Trapani said he follows his gut when it comes to making a movie. If it feels right, go for it; if not, something needs to change. He'll need his instincts to help him as he and his business partner, Brian Gilbert, move forward with other projects in their new production and management venture. Gilbert is the former production president of Stan Winston Studio, which was involved in such films as Jurassic Park, Alien and Iron Man, Trapani said. Trapani and Gilbert have already signed on for two Scooby Doo film sequels and a movie starring Nicholas Cage that will start filming early next year. The two are also involved in representing screenwriters and directors and helping them focus on their long-term career goals. Trapani admits that life can be a little overwhelming at times, especially since he can be working on 60 different projects at various stages of development. But he said he feeds off of it and is enthralled with film production. When things do get a little crazy on set, Trapani says that he thinks about Geoffrey Rush's character from \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Rush's character, Philip Henslowe, is asked how the play will be ready with so much madness going on around them. Rush replies, \"It's a mystery.\" He grew up in Saratoga, but it's Hollywood that Andy Trapani now calls home. Trapani is a movie producer, and his first major feature film,`The Haunting in Connecticut,' will hit the theaters on March 27.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Saratoga", "latitude": 37.2638, "longitude": -122.023}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "Hollywood", "latitude": 34.0983, "longitude": -118.327}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "Saratoga", "latitude": 37.2638, "longitude": -122.023}, {"name": "Los Angeles", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "Los Angeles", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "Los Angeles", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}, {"name": "Los Angeles", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, {"name": "Saratoga", "latitude": 37.2638, "longitude": -122.023}, {"name": "Hollywood", "latitude": 34.0983, "longitude": -118.327}, {"name": "Connecticut", "latitude": 41.667, "longitude": -72.6665}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

SACRAMENTO \u2014 Investors this week flocked to California's first major bond sale in nine months, a development that will soon free up billions of dollars for public works projects put on hold because of the state's budget mess. State Treasurer Bill Lockyer announced that the state sold $6.54 billion in general obligation bonds on Monday and Tuesday, easily surpassing a $4 billion target he had set going into the sale. His office said late Tuesday it was the largest long-term general obligation bond sale \"ever in the country.\" The tax-exempt bonds carry yields ranging from 3.2 to 6.1 percent, depending on when they mature (from 2013 to 2038). \"This is a great result for California's workers, businesses and economy,\" Lockyer said in a statement. California has been shut out of the debt market because of its budget mess and the tight national credit market. And without the ability to sell bonds, the state was forced to freeze about $2.6 billion in financing since December for more than 5,000 infrastructure projects. With the deficit addressed for the time being with the plan signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month, officials said recently that they expect soon to unfreeze $500 million in infrastructure funds that had been put on hold. But after this week's sale, they are expected to unlock an additional $2.6 billion for public works projects, although it could take several weeks to disburse the money. Roxanne Miller, a lobbyist for the city of San Jose, said that can't happen soon enough. Dozens of projects in San Jose are awaiting financing from the state's so-called Pooled Money Investment Account, including a $15 million traffic light synchronization project; $5.5 million for improvements to public trails; and several million dollars for affordable housing projects. With the state's finances in shambles, San Jose has had to front the money to keep many of those projects going, Miller said. But that can continue only for so long. \"We're getting to the point where everyone needs some indication, some certainty that the money will be there,\" she said. Miller added that a $10 million project to upgrade Highway 101 at Tully Road, scheduled to begin construction within months, will be put on hold if state infrastructure funds aren't unleashed soon. She called the successful bond sale \"a big deal for all of us.\" The state's move to freeze infrastructure funds was at odds not only with Schwarzenegger's stated priorities but with the federal stimulus package approved last month. Last week, the governor held a news conference to tout 57 projects in line to receive the first injection of federal stimulus dollars for transportation, totaling $626 million.

We need to get to the reform-related issues before we do anything else,\" said Rep. Joseph F. Wagner, D-Chicopee, the co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Transportation. \"The public wants to see what we are going to do to fix a system that is broken.\" The announcement came as the five-member board of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority is scheduled to meet 3 p.m. on Monday at Ludlow Town Hall. Although the authority on Monday is expected to vote to delay a toll increase in or near Boston, Wagner said he will ask board members to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in West Stockbridge and Exit 6 near Springfield as a way to generate money for maintenance of the western end of the turnpike. He said Monday's meeting would be an appropriate time and place for the board to weigh bringing back those tolls as well as a toll in West Newton that also was taken down in 1996, but as of Thursday, the issue was not on the board's agenda for Monday. The Boston toll increase was scheduled to take effect in two stages starting on March 29. The governor, Senate President Therese Murray, D-Plymouth, and House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, D-Winthrop, and turnpike officials have agreed to use turnpike reserve money to ward off the March 29 toll increase while they negotiate a more comprehensive answer for the state's transportation financing shortfall. The authority had approved the toll increases last month, turning up the heat on legislators to act on a bill to boost the gas tax as a way to prevent the toll hikes. Instead, Thursday's agreement gives legislators some more time to weigh Patrick's bill for a 19-cent increase in the state's 23.5-cent gas tax. Wagner said there is no support in the Legislature for the 19-cent increase Patrick proposed in his transportation bill submitted last month. Wagner said he couldn't say how much of an increase in the gas tax that legislators might support. \"I get the clear sense that 10 cents may be too much,\" Wagner said. The western portion of the turnpike is a separate financial operation from the road east of Route 128. If tolls were reinstated between Exits 1 and 6, Wagner said, it would provide more money for maintaining the western end of the turnpike. \"The road is in a terrible state of disrepair,\" Wagner said. \"It's clear the turnpike doesn't have the revenues to maintain that road.\" Rep. Donald F. Humason, R-Westfield, said he would support restoring tolls between Exits 1 and 6 if the revenues are used to improve the western part of the turnpike. Humason said he is concerned, however, with the plan by legislative leaders to approve a reform bill next week while delaying a possible tax increase until sometime before July 1. Humason said there would not be enough time for the reforms to kick in and save some money. \"Put the reforms in place,\" Humason said. \"Let them stand for a year. Let them stand for six months. Give them a chance to work.\" The authority has lost $12 million a year since it eliminated tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in West Stockbridge near the New York border and Exit 6 at Interstate 291 in Chicopee in 1996, according to Mary Z. Connaughton, of Framingham, a turnpike board member. Connaughton said she supports reinstating tolls for passenger vehicles in Western Massachusetts to generate money for maintenance for that section of the turnpike. She also wants to reinstate tolls on that section of the road because tolls are set to increase in Boston and the turnpike extension in Boston. Connaughton said bringing back tolls between Exits 1 and 6 would also help assure that the turnpike from Route 128 westward becomes free of tolls in eight years. Under current authority plans, bonds are to be paid off in 2017 on the 123-mile western portion from the New York border to Route 128. Under state law, the tolls are supposed to be removed when construction debt is paid. Connaughton said she is concerned that the commissioner of the state Highway Department could refuse to accept the western end of the turnpike as a state road if it is in poor condition in 2017. Connaughton wants the turnpike authority on Monday to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exit 1 and Exit 6. The western end of the turnpike is currently operating at a deficit of about $15 million a year if the authority spends what it should on bridge repairs, paving and other capital projects, according to a report by the state Transportation Finance Commission. The turnpike board's meeting on Monday will center around an expected vote to delay a big toll increase scheduled to take place in Boston and on the turnpike extension east of Route 128. The first stage of the toll increase will boost tolls from $1.25 to $1.50 at the Allston and Weston booths and from $3.50 to $5.50 at the Boston Harbor tunnels. A second toll increase, due to take effect July 1, will raise the tolls at Allston and Weston to $2 and the tunnel tolls to $7. Board members approved those toll increases to help pay off $2.2 billion in debt left from the $14.8 billion Big Dig, maintenance and capital improvements.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Mass.", "latitude": 42.3656, "longitude": -71.1083}, {"name": "Chicopee", "latitude": 42.1726, "longitude": -72.5949}, {"name": "Massachusetts", "latitude": 42.3656, "longitude": -71.1083}, {"name": "Ludlow", "latitude": 42.1601, "longitude": -72.4759}, {"name": "Boston", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.0598}, {"name": "West Stockbridge", "latitude": 42.3459, "longitude": -73.3662}, {"name": "Springfield", "latitude": 42.1015, "longitude": -72.5898}, {"name": "West Newton", "latitude": 42.3501, "longitude": -71.2328}, {"name": "Boston", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.0598}, {"name": "Plymouth", "latitude": 41.9584, "longitude": -70.6673}, {"name": "Winthrop", "latitude": 42.3751, "longitude": -70.9828}, {"name": "Westfield", "latitude": 42.1251, "longitude": -72.7495}, {"name": "West Stockbridge", "latitude": 42.3459, "longitude": -73.3662}, {"name": "New York", "latitude": 43.0003, "longitude": -75.4999}, {"name": "Chicopee", "latitude": 42.1726, "longitude": -72.5949}, {"name": "Framingham", "latitude": 42.2793, "longitude": -71.4162}, {"name": "Massachusetts", "latitude": 42.3656, "longitude": -71.1083}, {"name": "Boston", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.0598}, {"name": "Boston", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.0598}, {"name": "New York", "latitude": 43.0003, "longitude": -75.4999}, {"name": "Boston", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.0598}, {"name": "Allston", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.1259}, {"name": "Weston", "latitude": 42.3668, "longitude": -71.3031}, {"name": "Boston Harbor", "latitude": 42.3418, "longitude": -70.9662}, {"name": "Allston", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.1259}, {"name": "Weston", "latitude": 42.3668, "longitude": -71.3031}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Chapman Valve at Goodwin and Pinevale streets once was the world's largest manufacturers of all kinds of valves, including fire hydrants, and employed nearly 3,500 people. The plant moved here from Boston in 1874. Crane Co., of Chicago, bought the company in 1959 and closed it in 1988. The plant milled uranium at Chapman Valve in the late 1940s in a nuclear power project for the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y. The U.S. Navy cleaned the site and recent city tests have shown it to be radiation-free, officials have said. But the site also is likely to contain oils, asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyl, commonly known as PCB's, man-made organic chemicals banned in 1979, officials have said. Another problem is the discovery in the past few years of a series of underground tunnels and pits, prompting questions about the strength of the foundation. The Chapman Valve plant has been demolished. The city owns two parcels, or nearly 14 acres. The remaining 39 acres are controlled by private owners, including Crane Co., which still owns about half an acre, said Christopher J. Moskal, senior project manager with the city Office of Planning and Economic Development. The urban renewal designation lets the city begin negotiating with the 39 acres' owners, Brian M. Connors, acting city chief development officer, said before the meeting. The designation must be approved by the state Department of Housing and Community Development.

April presents some interesting celestial scenes. \"Saturn looks really lovely at this time of year,\" Thacher said. Its rings are edge on, enabling sky-gazers to view the brightest of Saturn's many moons. On Friday, the moon is in its first quarter, a perfect time to observe the lunar landscape. \"You can really see the craters,\" she said. Just going outside and looking at the moon with the naked eye is one thing. It can be beautiful, and some details are evident. But add a telescope, and it's a whole new experience. \"The level of detail is amazing,\" Thacher said. If peering at the moon seems too ordinary, what about a nebula? The Orion Nebula is one of the closest star formation regions. Because it is so close to earth, it is a great location to see how stars are born and progress. \"It's several times the size of our own solar system,\" Thacher said. \"These are stars formed by dust and gas. The light is so strong that it can push away the dust,\" she said. Through the telescope, these formations are remarkable to view, she said. Other events in the region are scheduled for 100 Hours of Astronomy. The Springfield Science Museum will host \"Stars Over Springfield\" on Friday at 7:30 p.m. Amateur astronomer Michael Kozicki will speak on \"Saturn's Disappearing Rings.\" Members of the Springfield Stars Club will be on hand, and participants may gaze at the stars in the museum observatory and through telescopes on the Quadrangle green. The cost is $3 for adults and $2 for children. Amherst College's Wilder Observatory open house at 9 p.m. on Saturday will give people a chance to use the 6-ton Clark Refractor as well as smaller telescopes set up by the Amherst Area Amateur Astronomy Association. The association also will offer a free program, Safe Solar Observing on Saturday from 1 to 2:30 p.m. at the Amherst Common and from 3 to 4:30 p.m. at A2Z Science and Learning Center in Northampton.

In the years that area health care leaders have struggled with how to care for the uninsured -- while limiting unnecessary use of hospital emergency rooms -- the problems have only gotten worse. The 2008 economic downturn rendered many jobless, without insurance and without the extra cash for medical care. Without coverage for routine doctor visits, the uninsured often wait to seek preventive care and medical treatment until they're very sick, requiring costlier care in ERs. Others use ERs as their source for primary care but can't pay the bill. Hospitals make up that uncompensated care in other areas by charging more or eliminating some services. Here's a local snapshot. - Springfield hospital emergency room visits by uninsured Greene County residents grew from 17,709 visits in 2003 to 33,760 visits in 2007, the latest compiled data available. - The most common reasons for those ER visits by the uninsured were dental pain, dental/respiratory complaints, respiratory/lumbar, throat problems, alcohol/neck sprain/respiratory, and ear complaints. - The Kitchen Clinic saw 2,000 patients in 2008, or 8,000 patient visits, and turns away hundreds of people every month for lack of providers. It gave more than 47,000 free prescriptions, up from 42,000 the year before. - CoxHealth system provided $33.5 million in bad debt and charity care in fiscal year 2003, $64.3 million in 2006, and by 2007 it increased to $93.6 million. In 2008 it rose by another 13 percent, to $105.9 million. (Calculation for charity and bad debt is based on write-offs from patient charges.) The combined emergency department and urgent care visits for Cox North, South and Walnut Lawn rose from 145,000 in fiscal year 2007 to 151,000 in fiscal year 2008. The Cox ERs, alone, saw 104,000 patients in 2008. -St. John's Health System write-offs for bad debts and charity combined was $93.4 million in fiscal year 2006, $117.6 million in fiscal year 2007, and totaled $144.1 million in fiscal year 2008. (This increase is due to an increase in the number of uninsured patients and an increase in the number of insured patients who have not met the patient portion of their co-payments and deductibles.) One out of every five patients who visit the ER does not carry insurance. St. John's ER visits totaled 87,600 in fiscal year 2008, representing a 3.6 percent increase over the fiscal year 2007 ER visits of 84,500. Source: Springfield hospitals, Springfield-Greene County Health Department \"We all provide a significant amount of coverage for the indigent ...\" said Kim Day, president and CEO of St. John's Health System and a commission member. \" ... The economic times, combined with the fact that funding to safety-net providers is drying up, has frankly caused us to work harder, together.\" \"The commission's public-private partnership with the community is not a substitute for state or national reform,\" Day said, \"but we hope our efforts will increase access to health care services for vulnerable people, improving health outcomes in an unhealthy state and region, and reduce costs in the long run.\" It's patterned after the successful St. Louis Regional Health Commission, recognized nationally for helping coordinate existing services and money to boost primary care and dental visits among the city's working poor. It's one of about 10 U.S. city initiatives having success increasing access, reducing chronic health problems and cutting their hospitals' charitable care load, Bradshaw said. A board is spearheading the commission, including Day, Edwards, Gipson and Miller, Brian Fogle with The Kitchen Inc., John Lilly with the Greene County Medical Society, and Paul Taylor, CEO of Ozarks Community Hospital (formerly Doctors Hospital of Springfield). Others will be added from government, business and the community. In St. Louis, a financially troubled group of primary care clinics consolidated with a Jordan Valley-style community health center. The once-strapped clinics became eligible for federal funding, patients had access to more federal services like disease management, and the money saved was used to hire more health care providers, Fruend said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Springfield", "latitude": 37.2153, "longitude": -93.2982}, {"name": "Greene County", "latitude": 37.2667, "longitude": -93.3502}, {"name": "Cox North", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "South", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Walnut Lawn", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Springfield", "latitude": 37.2153, "longitude": -93.2982}, {"name": "Springfield", "latitude": 37.2153, "longitude": -93.2982}, {"name": "Greene County", "latitude": 37.2667, "longitude": -93.3502}, {"name": "St. Louis", "latitude": 38.6273, "longitude": -90.1979}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -98.5}, {"name": "Springfield", "latitude": 37.2153, "longitude": -93.2982}, {"name": "St. Louis", "latitude": 38.6273, "longitude": -90.1979}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. Washington \u2014 By most measures, the $787 billion economic stimulus bill that President Barack Obama signed into law in February appears to be positively flying into the hands of state and local governments. Each week, the administration announces new formulas and new releases of funds, followed by a flurry of press releases from congressional offices touting the newest stimulus dollars in your neighborhood. According to those releases, the state has been approved for money for dilapidated National Guard armories, for hospitals to treat vulnerable populations and to spruce up crumbling highways. For a federal bureaucracy, it's as close to lightning-speed as it gets. But what the state actually has in hand is far less than what the press releases suggest. So far, the state has received just a fraction of the funds it's been notified that it will receive. The money it has received includes a little more than $388 million for Medicaid and a few million dollars for food for Ohio's aging population. \"It's out there,\" promises Dennis Evans of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, who said the state has been notified it will receive $298 million more in the months to come. \"It all depends on when the feds start laying it out there for everyone.\" In some cases, the grant process is all that's keeping the money from flowing. Communities getting grants on a formula basis have often been notified of their share of specific programs, but have to apply to get the funds. That's the case with the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. When doled out, those will give $61.6 million to the state. In the case of the federal highway transportation funds allocated this week, much of the money has to go through the state budget process before it can be spent. The state will pay for the projects and then be reimbursed by the federal government. \"Obviously our goal is getting this money invested in the economy as soon as possible,\" said Amanda Wurst, a spokeswoman for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland.

Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. XENIA \u2014 The girlfriend of the alleged drug dealer who hanged himself in a Georgia jail last summer after being snared in a nationwide manhunt agreed Monday, March 30, to a plea deal that should spare her from prison. Chelsie D. Hornsburger, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering in Greene County Common Pleas Court. In exchange for her testimony against other members of a drug ring allegedly led by former Yellow Springs resident Umoja Iddi Bakari, prosecutors recommended she receive probation. The charges, both third degree felonies, carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Hornsburger admitted to collecting drug debts on Bakari's behalf, two of which were $1,000 transactions with members of the Greene County Drug Task Force, according to court records. \"This is a good example of how someone who is naive can be sucked into a drug enterprise,\" said Suzanne Schmidt, first assistant prosecutor. Hornsburger also admitted to receiving drugs through the mail for Bakari and mailing drug payments to Arizona and California. Hornsburger met Bakari in 2007 and he told her he was a single dad. She later learned he was still married and operating a drug operation that brought marijuana and cocaine from Columbus to Yellow Springs for distribution, according to officials. Prosecutors also have indicted Bakari's wife, Bekelech M. Asefa, 26, of Canal Winchester, Ohio near Columbus, who faces 20 felony counts including racketeering and money laundering. She entered a not guilty plea to the charges earlier this month and is free without bond. Bakari fled the Columbus area last May before police raided several homes he owned there and arrested Hornsburger. Officers caught up with Bakari near Atlanta in June, but he hung himself with a T-shirt in jail shortly after his arrest. Police are still searching for Robert McDonald Jr., a former Greene County resident, who allegedly helped Bakari sell drugs.

Moore said she resigned from her position a few weeks ago because of \"personal problems with the mayor.\" Moore said her family is intertwined with that of Hanes, but declined to comment further about the situation.

Family members, prison officials and funeral home staff provided different stories about why Ricky Karg Jr. was unable to visit his daughter one last time before she was buried last weekend. Karg, who is serving a sentence on charges of receiving stolen property and failure to comply, was told of his daughter's death during a visitation period on March 23, about two days after the fire, said Jackie Rutherford, his sister and Cassie's aunt. While the family and the funeral home requested that he be allowed to visit his daughter, the request was eventually denied, she said. Instead, she said, Karg wrote a letter that was placed in his daughter's casket during a viewing Friday. \"He's not a hardened criminal and I think he should have had a chance to see his daughter,\" Rutherford said. The public viewing was scheduled to take place at Graham Middle School, but the correctional facility's policy prohibits inmates from visiting schools, said Angela Hill, a public information officer at the reception center. The facility also tried to schedule a private viewing, Hill said, but prison officials were not able to do so because the funeral home was unable to provide a specific time when the casket would be available. \"Because there were so many factors, we weren't able to make the arrangements, which had to be done in advance to allow (Ricky Karg) to get to a private viewing,\" Hill said. But Dave Vernon, director of Vernon's Funeral Home in Urbana, said he tried to work with the state and the family to coordinate a special visit, going as far as offering to transport the casket to Mechanicsburg, where it would be closer to the Correctional Reception Center in Orient where Ricky Karg.

Sommers said that he saw two major problems for Springfield: a need to improve student achievement and regain \"marketshare,\" or students who are going to charter, voucher and open enrollment options. \"There is no reason that Springfield City Schools cannot only regain its marketshare, but also become the premier place where you turn to go to school,\" he said.

The city's voting system is completely computerized. Mac Jones of Phenix City, after casting votes voting with his wife, Rosie, said he expected lines to be long there. He was pleasantly surprised at the smooth flow despite the crowds coming and going around him. \"Perhaps it is Barack; everybody's excited about that,\" Jones said of the enthusiastic turnout for an election that pitted Barack Obama, the nation's first black major party presidential candidate, against John McCain, whose running mate, Sarah Palin, was vying Tuesday to be the country's first female vice president. \"It's going to be history one way or the other.\" One of the largest opening crowds appeared to be at Rothschild Middle School. When poll manager Sandy Dowdell drove up to the school at 5:30 a.m., he was surprised to see about 50 people standing in line. Some of them brought folding chairs and blankets. By the time the precinct opened at 7 a.m., there were about 250 in line, he said. From 7-10:30 a.m. things were very the precinct was busy, he said. But election planners had many tools an answer to ease the crunch. \"People were saying how orderly and organized it was,\" Dowdell said. \"There were a lot of first-time voters. I know there were three 18-year-olds voting for the first time. Their mothers brought them.\" Because the voter turnout was predicted to be huge this year, each precinct set up queue lines similar to those at amusement parks.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Chattahoochee River", "latitude": 30.7088, "longitude": -84.8638}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 32.461, "longitude": -84.9877}, {"name": "Phenix City", "latitude": 32.471, "longitude": -85.0008}, {"name": "Phenix City", "latitude": 32.471, "longitude": -85.0008}, {"name": "Alabama", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -86.7503}, {"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -83.5002}, {"name": "Alabama", "latitude": 32.7504, "longitude": -86.7503}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 32.461, "longitude": -84.9877}, {"name": "Phenix City", "latitude": 32.471, "longitude": -85.0008}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Columbus attorney Stephen Hyles has unseated Municipal Court Judge Haywood Turner. According to unofficial vote totals, Hyles had 61 percent of the vote to Turner's 39. Hyles finished with 42,600 votes to Turner's 27,058. \"I intend to work hard to make sure the people who supported me are glad they did so,\" Hyles said. \"I intend to work to earn the support of those who did not support me and hope to earn their support so they will support me the next time.\" By the time the results were final \u0097 after 1 a.m. \u0097 Turner had left his campaign headquarters and was unavailable for comment. This was the first time that Turner has faced opposition since he was elected unopposed two decades ago. Hyles, a defense attorney, was on Columbus Council from 1986-93. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1992, when Bobby Peters was elected for his first of two terms. Hyles geared up his campaign to take advantage of early voting, and it appeared to pay off with a big advantage in the votes cast before Tuesday. \"There has been a paradigm shift in the election process,\" Hyles said. \"Nov. 4 is no longer the election day. It is only the last day to vote.\" Prior to the election, Turner admitted he was surprised that a challenge came from Hyles. \"There is no inference to suggest he is anything other than a good man,\" the judge said. \"He is more civilized than I and deserves a court with a higher jurisdictional limit.\" Turner has been in the news a number of times, most recently in April 2007 when he was accused of pointing a gun at another motorist. He was convicted of reckless driving, a charge that was reduced from pointing a pistol at another. He was sentenced to 12 months on probation, fined $1,000, ordered to perform 40 hours of community service and required to attend an anger management class. At the time, the police report stated that Turner said the gun was in its holster when he held it up. Today, he says he never pointed the gun at the other driver. He waved an empty holster, he said. \"I never brandished a gun,\" Turner said. \"I did not even own the type of gun described.\" In August 2002, Turner was in the middle of a pay dispute with Columbus Council. He was reluctant to issue a $625 fine to a California man for speeding, fearing that the money would likely be \"wasted\" in the hands of the city. That same morning, when a citizen complained about city inaction over a traffic signal, Turner turned up the volume by suggesting that setting off \"a nuclear bomb atop the Government Center\" might be the only way of getting Columbus councilors' attention. He later apologized for the remarks that angered city officials. In the aftermath, Turner's salary was raised from nearly $72,000 to almost $90,000. Today, the Municipal Court judge's job pays about $105,000 annually. Both men ran a clean campaign.

When Ernest Shivers stands over a vat of frying fish, good things happen. How else do you come to be known as \u201cThe Fish Man\u201d by people from as far as Texas and Washington, D.C.? Shivers has spent more than a decade traveling to festivals and football games around the country, where he unhitches a trailer and goes to work frying up croaker, whiting, perch and pretty much any other good-tasting seafood he can find. Now, he's going full time with a restaurant that opened this month on White Street about a mile east of downtown Rock Hill. Shivers hopes customers at the new joint, called Ernie's Place, will learn the reason behind his nickname. \u201cPeople line up just to get that fish,\u201d Shivers said. \u201cThey like my cooking. I think it's just God's gift, because my ingredients really aren't that complicated.\u201d At 57, Shivers is ready to do what he enjoys after a life spent in various jobs. He's driven a truck, fixed cars and worked in textile mills. But the need to fry has never left him. Dressed in white slacks, a chef's hat and a red apron and bandanna, Shivers looks as at home in the kitchen as Tiger Woods on the 18th hole at Augusta. It has been this way since Shivers was 16, cooking his own dinner every night while he earned his GED. \u201cI was just meant to be a cook,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried all kinds of things, but cooking stuck with me.\u201d Any owner will tell you that running a restaurant is a grueling business. The building on White Street has changed hands a number of times over the years. But Shivers says he'll get plenty of help from his wife, Thomasenia, and son Shaune, 26, who helps with the cooking and is said to make a mean peach cobbler. Shivers has already proven himself to an audience with high standards, said friend A.C. Jamison. That would be the students and alumni at Columbia's Benedict College. They flock to The Fish Man's trailer every year at the annual Harambee festival. Jamison, the father of former University of North Carolina basketball star and NBA standout Antawn Jamison, stopped in for a cheeseburger one afternoon last week. He knows Shivers through the Elks Club, where they both are members. Turns out, they don't call Shivers \u201cThe Burger Man,\u201d but he makes those pretty well, too. At Benedict, Jamison said, they know the difference between a real cook and a pretender. \u201cIf you don't know what you're doing, you won't get invited back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to food, they don't play. If they don't like something, they'll let you know.\u201d Aside from seafood and burgers, the menu at Ernie's Place includes turkey wings, hot dogs and hush puppies. Monday brings the rib plate special, with beef stew not far behind on Tuesday. But the fish, Shivers hopes, will keep them coming back. The secret lies in the mix of spices and breading that he uses to coat the fish before dropping them into the fryer. So what's the recipe? \u201cI don't give that away,\u201d Shivers said. \u201cSomebody will try to duplicate it.\u201d Like a magician, \u201cThe Fish Man\u201d doesn't reveal his secrets.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.2504, "longitude": -99.2506}, {"name": "Washington", "latitude": 38.8951, "longitude": -77.0364}, {"name": "D.C.", "latitude": 38.9171, "longitude": -77.0003}, {"name": "White Street", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Rock Hill", "latitude": 34.9249, "longitude": -81.0251}, {"name": "Augusta", "latitude": 33.471, "longitude": -81.9748}, {"name": "Columbia", "latitude": 34.0007, "longitude": -81.0348}, {"name": "North Carolina", "latitude": 35.5007, "longitude": -80.0003}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

COLUMBIA -- The sometimes-fierce nine-year battle over raising South Carolina's lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax could end quietly this month. S.C. House Republicans and Democrats think they have a plan both sides can support to increase the tax. The plan is modeled after an Oklahoma program that uses cigarette tax revenue to secure matching federal money. That federal money then is used to provide a subsidy to buy health insurance for low-income residents or small businesses that could not afford insurance. \u201cIt looked like Oklahoma found a way to include the federal match,\u201d said House Speaker Bobby Harrell, the plan's author. \u201cThat is critical to making sure there is enough money in the fund to cover a large number of uninsured people.\u201d Last year, the House and Senate approved a 50-cent-a-pack increase. But disagreement over how the money would be spent meant the House could not override Gov. Mark Sanford's veto. If approved by the federal government, the House plan would raise the state cigarette tax by 50 cents a pack, raising about $147 million. That money, matched about 2-for-1 with federal Medicaid money, would provide tax credits to employers worth about 75 percent of the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. \"This is a compromise between people who want something tax-neutral and those folks who want to expand Medicaid,\" Harrell said.

From an improved U.S. 21 bridge over the Catawba River to more guards at the county jail, local government officials are pursuing federal stimulus money for a host of priorities. Some are road widenings aimed at easing traffic or kickstarting multimillion dollar private developments. Others are described as urban renewal efforts to help neighborhoods with high crime rates move toward stability. Because so many places are competing for dollars, there is uncertainty over which requests will actually get money. \u201cYou can imagine all the other cities and counties doing what we're doing,\u201d said York County Council Chairman Buddy Motz. \u201cEverybody is scrambling to try to get some of the funds. We just need to make sure we're in the line.\u201d In many cases, the projects have been on the books for months or years, but sufficient money hasn't been available. One example is the U.S. 21 bridge over the Catawba River. Local leaders have long wanted to replace the famously narrow two-lane bridge, where drivers can come within inches of each other as they pass. But plans call for more than just a new bridge. Under an agreement between Rock Hill, Fort Mill and York County, the new version would get pedestrian and bike lanes, light poles and a new fa\u00e7ade aimed at making it a more distinctive feature. Supporters say the enhanced bridge could be a landmark along Interstate 77, and a popular attraction for hikers and kayakers along the Catawba River, where the Carolina Thread Trail runs through York County. Other projects have a more direct connection to spurring private investment. A private group planning a $600 million redevelopment at the old Celanese site has said Cel-River Road must be improved before it can move ahead with its plans. The proposed Riverwalk development will house one of the biggest industrial parks in the Charlotte region, along with a shopping center similar to Birkdale Village in Huntersville, N.C., and hundreds of homes and townhouses. It will take 10 to 15 years to complete, but officials say an improved Cel-River Road is the key to getting started. \u201cIt overshadows all the rest of them,\u201d said Rock Hill City Manager Carey Smith, in terms of economic impact and job creation. \u201cIt allows that industrial park to take off.\u201d The top priority is the S.C. 5 Bypass widening, which would widen the road from S.C. 5 west to S.C. 161. An estimated $19 million is needed to complete the project. Other projects are listed, along with cost needed to complete them: Roads aren't the only items on the list. County leaders also hope to use stimulus money to hire corrections officers at the Moss Justice Detention Center. The county has already hired 16 officers, but needs another 31 to man the expanded facility. Beginning corrections officer cost the county $43,743 in salary and benefits per year. \u201cYou can imagine, this is about the worst possible time to be adding 31 people,\u201d County Manager Jim Baker said. \u201cIf we're relying on our own resources, it'd be very difficult. We'd either be faced with not opening the facility or potentially pulling some of our deputies from the street.\u201d The path to securing stimulus money is anything but direct, with various pots of dollars available in different places. Legislation approved by Congress makes money available in education, technology, law enforcement and infrastructure. The Rock Hill school district would use stimulus money to replace funding that has been cut by the state, said Harriet Jaworowski, associate superintendent for instruction. Rather than launching new initiatives, the money would be put toward existing needs, such as tutoring programs. Some stimulus money could go directly to neighborhoods. For example, Rock Hill wants $180,000 to help build an asphalt trail connecting the Hagins-Fewell neighborhood to downtown. On the Saluda Street corridor, where revitalization efforts have been under way for years, officials are seeking $250,000 to create a gateway entrance at the S.C. 901 intersection. Plans call for a monument sign and landscaping to greet drivers entering Rock Hill's south side from I-77. Meanwhile, the county might pursue money to create a summer work program for youth. With entry-level jobs now being taken by adults, high school and college students are expected to have a tougher time finding work when school lets out.

Some Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah have welcomed the failure of the prisoner exchange negotiations between Israel and Hamas as good news. Palestinian women attend a protest held by the Islamic Jihad movement calling for the release of prisoners jailed in Israel. Photo: AP \"I know several Palestinian officials here who were happy to hear that the talks between Israel and Hamas had collapsed,\" he said. \"They were concerned that such a deal would embolden Hamas and undermine the credibility of Fatah.\" The reopening of the crossings, especially the Rafah terminal, would only help Hamas tighten its grip on Gaza, the official pointed out. \"We must not forget that Hamas seized power in the Gaza Strip through a military coup [in 2007]. As such, Hamas is not a legitimate authority there,\" he said. The PA was also worried the release of hundreds of Hamas operatives to their homes in the West Bank would have created a big headache for its security forces. The PA would have preferred to see many of the Hamas prisoners and their families \"relocated\" to other areas, such as the Gaza Strip. Hassan Salameh, Ibrahim Hamed, Abdullah Barghouti, Abbas a-Sayed and Jamal Abu al-Hija were behind one of Hamas's deadliest military infrastructures in the West Bank. As experts in preparing various types of explosive devices, they are responsible for the killing of hundreds of people during the second intifada. Abbas's aides are not worried as much about the parties that would be held for the released Hamas prisoners as about the high probability the released men would rebuild their movement's military infrastructure in the West Bank and resume terror activities not only against Israel, but also against the PA. The crackdown, PA officials explained, was a preemptive measure designed to thwart any attempt by Hamas to extend its control to the West Bank. As far as these officials are concerned, the tough anti-Hamas measures are \"working.\" Today, there's almost no such thing as a Hamas political or military leadership in the West Bank, since most of the movement's prominent figures are either in Israeli prisons or in Abbas's detention centers. Another PA official said the only way to \"minimize the damage\" resulting from a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas was by persuading Israel to release a large number of inmates as a gesture to Abbas and Fatah. He said it would be a \"disaster\" for Abbas if Israel released important prisoners such as Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti in the context of a deal with Hamas and not Fatah.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Palestinian", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Ramallah", "latitude": 31.9, "longitude": 35.2}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Palestinian", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Palestinian", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Rafah", "latitude": 31.2842, "longitude": 34.2508}, {"name": "Gaza", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.4667}, {"name": "Gaza Strip", "latitude": 31.4167, "longitude": 34.3333}, {"name": "West Bank", "latitude": 31.6667, "longitude": 35.25}, {"name": "Gaza Strip", "latitude": 31.4167, "longitude": 34.3333}, {"name": "West Bank", "latitude": 31.6667, "longitude": 35.25}, {"name": "West Bank", "latitude": 31.6667, "longitude": 35.25}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "West Bank", "latitude": 31.6667, "longitude": 35.25}, {"name": "West Bank", "latitude": 31.6667, "longitude": 35.25}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The lawsuit was filed by 10 people who claimed their constitutional rights were violated during the Dec. 12, 2006, enforcement action dubbed Operation Wagon Train. The raid followed a 10-month investigation into the alleged use and distribution of fraudulent identity documents by Swift employees in six states. Immigration agents arrested 239 people on immigration violations in Worthington, out of a total of more than 1,200. Twenty of them were also charged with identity theft or related counts.

He cited airport development, wastewater treatment and water delivery as \u201csome big infrastructure I think we do need to have a general plan about where we are going.\u201d Freelen agreed that long-term planning in those areas would give future councils some type of guidelines as well as serve as a measurement tool to show \u201cwhere we have been and where we are going.\u201d Although Brown said he would have liked to have the bullet list presented Monday \u201c18 months ago,\u201d the councilman added, \u201cFrom this you look at it and then you make your strategic plan. I like that \u0097 at least we have a start now.\u201d Freelen asked Carruth to schedule a meeting with Anglin and Kampfer and to make regular reports on the planning process.

Valerie Shaffer, manager of business attraction for the Economic Development Corporation of Wayne County, said she is still working with company officials to bring them here but admitted \u201cthey were discouraged when they heard the grant program had been frozen.\u201d Fuelberth agreed the deal is not dead but added that he will investigate incentives offered by surrounding states.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Richmond", "latitude": 39.8289, "longitude": -84.8902}, {"name": "Denver", "latitude": 39.7392, "longitude": -104.985}, {"name": "Richmond", "latitude": 39.8289, "longitude": -84.8902}, {"name": "Denver", "latitude": 39.7392, "longitude": -104.985}, {"name": "Indiana", "latitude": 40.0003, "longitude": -86.2503}, {"name": "Indiana", "latitude": 40.0003, "longitude": -86.2503}, {"name": "Wayne County", "latitude": 39.8178, "longitude": -84.9964}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

France's immigration minister criticized a film director on Monday for likening the situation of illegal immigrants in France today to that of Jews under the Nazi occupation during World War Two. Director Philippe Lioret - whose film \"Welcome\" about illegal immigrants trying to reach Britain from northern France opens on Wednesday - has criticized a French law that makes it a crime to help illegal immigrants. \"To see that a decent guy can all of a sudden be charged and that he can go to prison is crazy. It feels like it's 1943 and we've hidden a Jew in the basement,\" Lioret told the regional newspaper La Voix du Nord last week. Some 76,000 Jews were arrested in France during World War Two and taken to concentration camps such as Auschwitz, where most died. Those found to be hiding Jews faced a similar fate. Immigration Minister Eric Besson told Europe 1 radio that comparing the plight of Afghans in the northern town of Calais to that of Jews during the occupation was \"intolerable\", and that Lioret had \"crossed the red line\". \"I have the impression that the film's promoters are committing a deliberate slur, no doubt with the intention of increasing publicity for the film's release,\" he said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has promoted a controversial tough immigration policy, which is widely believed to have won him the support of many far-right National Front voters in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy's policies include setting targets for police on the number of illegal immigrants they must expel each year. \"Welcome\" tells the story of a middle-aged lifeguard at a Calais swimming pool who, while trying to win back his wife's affections, meets a young Kurd and helps him swim across the Channel to Britain, where the young man's girlfriend lives. Vincent Lindon, who plays the lifeguard, has also spoken out about immigration policy in the run-up to the film's release, denouncing the often squalid conditions in which immigrants live while attempting to find a way into Britain. \"I believe we must respect human beings. The people in Calais are often treated worse than dogs. And I don't like that,\" Lindon told the newspaper Le Parisien in an interview published on Saturday. \"I do not understand that there is an article of the (law) that says: 'Any person who helps a person in an illegal situation is punishable by up to five years in prison'.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "France", "latitude": 46.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "France", "latitude": 46.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "Britain", "latitude": 54.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "France", "latitude": 46.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "France", "latitude": 46.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "Auschwitz", "latitude": 50.0333, "longitude": 19.2333}, {"name": "Calais", "latitude": 50.95, "longitude": 1.83333}, {"name": "Calais", "latitude": 50.95, "longitude": 1.83333}, {"name": "Britain", "latitude": 54.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "Britain", "latitude": 54.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "Calais", "latitude": 50.95, "longitude": 1.83333}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

President Shimon Peres launched a campaign a few days ago whose aim is to convince the international community that the \"Netanyahu-Lieberman-Barak\" government in the making will advance the peace process with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, senior European Union officials have sent messages to Benjamin Netanyahu making it clear that a refusal to adopt the \"two-state solution\" means freezing any upgrade in relations between Israel and Europe. Peres seeks to allay European and Arab suspicions about the Netanyahu government and the appointment of Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister. The president has been helping Netanyahu in his coalition negotiations with Kadima and the Labor Party, and was party to the secret talks between the Likud chairman and his Labor counterpart, Ehud Barak. In a phone call late last week to mark the 30th anniversary of Israeli-Egyptian peace, Peres told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that the agreements signed by Israel contain an obligation to promote a regional peace agreement as well as separate agreements with each of Israel's neighbors. \"In addition,\" Peres said, \"the new government will be obligated to honor all of the international agreements that have been signed.\" Sources close to Peres said yesterday that the president has transmitted similar messages in his talks with foreign leaders, which are expected to continue through Wednesday, when the new government is to be sworn in.

Syrian President Bashar Assad told the weekly magazine the New Yorker that though it may take some time, Syria still believes in the power of serious dialogue to produce a lasting peace with Israel. In an interview via email several days after Israel and Hamas declared unilateral cease-fires following Israel's three-week offensive in the Gaza Strip, Assad said that though Israel was \"doing everything possible to undermine the prospects for peace,\" he was still very interested in closing a deal. \"We have to wait a little while to see how things will evolve and how the situation changes,\" Assad wrote as Israel voted in a new government headed by Benjamin Netanyau. \"We still believe that we need to conclude a serious dialogue to lead us to peace,\" he declared. In the interview, Assad argued that Israel understands that the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War, is not negotiable. \"The Israelis know that we are not going to negotiate the line of 1967,\" Assad wrote, but suggested that compromises were possible. \"We only demarcate the line,\" he wrote. \"We negotiate the relations, the water and everything else.\" ? You discuss everything after the peace and getting your land. Not before,\" Assad stressed. \"Hezbollah is in Lebanon and Hamas is in Palestine,\" Assad continued. \"If they want to solve the problem with Hezbollah they have to deal with Lebanon. For Hamas, they have to deal with Gaza. For Iran, it is not part of the peace process anyway. This peace is about peace between Syria and Israel.\" The Syrian president reiterated his stance that it was now, more than ever, \"essential that the United States play a prominent and active role in the peace process,\" explaining that Syria required direct contact with U.S. President Barack Obama in order to advance the diplomatic process. Assad also lauded the diplomatic efforts of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, saying that \"Carter is most knowledgeable about the Middle East and he does not try to dictate or give sermons.

Senior EU officials have sent messages to Benjamin Netanyahu making it clear that a refusal to adopt the \"two-state solution\" means freezing any upgrade in relations between Israel and Europe. International trepidation over the incoming government's righward orientation prompted President Shimom Peres to launch a campaign a few days ago whose aim is to convince the world that the \"Netanyahu-Lieberman-Barak\" government will advance the peace process with the Palestinians. In a phone call late last week to mark the 30th anniversary of Israeli-Egyptian peace, Peres told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that the agreements signed by Israel contain an obligation to promote a regional peace agreement as well as separate agreements with each of Israel's neighbors. \"In addition,\" Peres said, \"the new government will be obligated to honor all of the international agreements that have been signed.\" Sources close to Peres said yesterday that the president has transmitted similar messages in his talks with foreign leaders, which are expected to continue through Wednesday, when the new government is to be sworn in.

The head of a Palestinian youth orchestra who set off an uproar by performing a concert for Holocaust survivors in Israel was blocked Tuesday from entering a West Bank refugee camp because of concerns for her safety, a local official said. Security official Radi Asiba said the life of the orchestra conductor, Wafa Younis, would have been at risk if she remained in the area of the Jenin refugee camp. Younis, an Arab woman from Israel, led a small orchestra for Palestinian youths in the hardscrabble camp. But she fell out of favor with residents after taking the orchestra to play for the Holocaust survivors last week. \"When Younis tried to enter the camp on Tuesday, she was halted by a prominent local leader,\" Asiba said. \"We informed her that she is forbidden from entering Jenin because her presence causes tensions,\" he said. Younis struck a sensitive nerve. Many Palestinians are reluctant to acknowledge Jewish historical suffering because of concerns that it weakens their own claims to victimhood and to the land. Ignorance and even denial of the Nazi genocide during World War II are common in Palestinian society. Parents said they were not told their children would perform for the Holocaust survivors. Residents of the Jenin camp are descendants of the some 700,000 Palestinians who either fled or were expelled from their homes in the war that followed Israel's creation, an event Arabs call the Naqba, or catastrophe. They said they were angry with Younis because their children had performed for Holocaust survivors while Israel had not acknowledged the suffering caused to them. Younis was not available for comment on Tuesday but earlier said she only meant to spread goodwill through the concert. On Sunday, camp officials boarded up Younis' rehearsal studio and confiscated the orchestra's music instruments: an electronic keyboard, a few kamanjas - an Arab instrument that looks like a violin - and some small drums. Younis established the Strings of Freedom orchestra around three years ago in the Jenin refugee camp.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Palestinian", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "West Bank", "latitude": 31.6667, "longitude": 35.25}, {"name": "Palestinian", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "West Bank", "latitude": 31.6667, "longitude": 35.25}, {"name": "Jenin", "latitude": 32.4564, "longitude": 35.2958}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Palestinian", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Jenin", "latitude": 32.4564, "longitude": 35.2958}, {"name": "Palestinians", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Palestinian", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Jenin", "latitude": 32.4564, "longitude": 35.2958}, {"name": "Palestinians", "latitude": 31.9216, "longitude": 35.2033}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Israel", "latitude": 31.5, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Jenin", "latitude": 32.4564, "longitude": 35.2958}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

And then, in the middle of a Northern Irish town and watched by Protestants and Catholics alike, he walked behind the coffin of a murdered policeman. Twelve years ago -- when the last Northern policeman was shot dead -- such a public tribute by a southern policing figure would have triggered a riot. Most children watching the sad procession yesterday never knew what it was like to live with the almost daily torrent of bombings and shootings. They do now. Many had heard a police wife tell in a radio interview how their 12-year-old son tearfully begged his father not to go to work this week. He didn't want him to get shot. Some of those who once followed a violent path are now in the North's government. Some are not, but they still came to Banbridge yesterday. They faced the TV cameras and appealed for the killings to stop and said there was no popular support for the dinosaurs still wedded to the past. The requiem Mass for Mr Carroll brought together a remarkable coalition of former terrorists, police officers, church leaders and politicians of all hues. Banbridge also turned out in force to say goodbye. Thousands lined the three-mile route from Mr Carroll's home to St Therese's church. A three-minute silence was held in the centre of the town and then the cortege passed, 18 officers walking ahead of the hearse, six motorcycle outriders ahead of them. A piper played a lament called the 'Flowers of the Forest' and mourners wept as the hearse passed by. Amid the roses, carnations and lilies, a floral tribute had also been sent from England by the family of murdered soldier Sapper Patrick Azimkar. As well as cards from his own parents, son Shane, siblings and grandchildren, Mr Carroll's heartbroken widow Kate left her own simple tribute. It said: \"To the love of my life. I will never forget you. I love you now and always, Kate.\" Then, she watched as her husband's casket, clad in a PSNI flag, was borne into the church by six fellow officers. \"He will nor be forgotten Kate, I promise you,\" Mr Orde said, adding Mr Carroll (48) knew an unexpected violent act like this could one day happen given the hatred in some hearts. Canon Liam Stevenson, the Banbridge parish priest, told mourners the killing of Mr Carroll was designed to destabilise the peace process. The word patriot, he said, had been horribly abused. \"The killers of Constable Carroll have abused the term patriotism. \"A perfectly laudable aspiration such as patriotism is robbed of its intrinsic value when it's allied to violence and death in pursuit of its objectives.\" Bishop McAreavey ended by sending a direct message to the killers: \"You are greatly mistaken.

Dan Delaney (18) and Ned Delaney (21), both of 1 Carrowclough, Tipperary, had been in custody since last week on charges of being intoxicated in a public place, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and assaulting or threatening to assault a garda carrying out their duty. John-Paul Delaney (18) of Upper Abbey Street, Cahir, is charged with assault, assault causing harm and theft of a mobile phone at Main Street, Tipperary, on the same date. The court heard that he was arrested after four gardai entered his address while he was in bed, during a major garda operation on Tuesday. Opposing bail in respect of Dan Delaney, John-Paul Delaney and Ned Delaney, Detective Inspector William Leahy said that there was \"a larger group\" of people who were involved in a number of incidents of intimidation over the last year. Following the incidents on St Patrick's Day, he had looked back over files of complaints, \"and a pattern has arisen where witnesses who made complaints about assaults either refused to make statements or, having made those statements, subsequently came into the garda station and withdrew them, and that's my fear today\". \"It's the State's contention,\" said Inspector Pascal Feeney, \"that over the past 12 months a number of injured parties or witnesses have withdrawn their statements as a result of intimidation and fear.\" The applications for bail were made by solicitors Vincent McCormack and Philip English.

Nigerian woman Pamela Izevbekhai yesterday insisted she had not fabricated a story about the death of her baby daughter in order to be allowed to remain in Ireland. Ms Izevbekhai \"totally rejected\" allegations that she manufactured the story to bolster her case against deportation. \"I did have a daughter Elizabeth and she did die as I said,\" said the Sligo-based mother who has been fighting a long-running legal battle against deportation. She has consistently maintained that her first daughter died at the age of 17 months after being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) and has argued that if the family is sent back to Nigeria her two younger daughters would be subjected to the same procedure. The mayor of Sligo, Veronica Cawley, yesterday stood by her decision to hold a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai last year while a spokesman for the Sligo-based Let Them Stay organisation said yesterday's reports raised more questions than they answered. Cllr Cawley said some people had suggested that she should apologise for holding the civic reception but she insisted: \"I have nothing to apologise for.\" At that function in Sligo Town Hall, Pamela wept as she said that Elizabeth would always be with the family and was a guardian angel for her sisters Naomi and Jemima. Cllr Cawley urged people not to jump to conclusions until all the facts come out. \"I have always said that the purpose of the civic reception was to highlight the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation and today I repeat my call for a worldwide ban on this torture,\" said Cllr Cawley. \"Before Pamela came to live in the north west, most us had never heard of FGM but there is a huge awareness now.'' \"These reports are only a snap shot in a long-running investigation which is not over yet,\" said Cllr Cawley. Cllr Cawley said that while a number of people had gone on local radio yesterday saying she should apologise for holding a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai \"everyone who phoned me today was supportive\". Supporters of Ms Izevbekhai pointed out that while Lagos-based obstetrician Dr Joseph Unokanjo was now claiming that he had never delivered a baby called Elizabeth Izevbekhai, and that he had never treated her for post-FGM blood loss, a doctor of the same name has in the past given interviews to RTE and Ocean FM in Sligo saying the opposite and supporting Pamela's account. They also pointed out that he is now saying that the baby he delivered for Pamela in 2000 was her first baby but she has a teenage son Adrian who lives with his father Tony in Nigeria. A spokesman for Let Them Stay questioned why this material had been leaked now and whether there was an agenda behind it. \"The safety of these two little girls should still be the main issue and I wonder is the Irish government saying that it is safe to send them back to Nigeria?\" he said. \"We would like to see Dr Unokanjo come on Irish radio again and see what he has to say now.\" He said supporters were concerned about why these claims were being made now, four years after Ms Izevbekhai first outlined her fears.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Nigerian", "latitude": 10.0, "longitude": 8.0}, {"name": "Ireland", "latitude": 53.0, "longitude": -8.0}, {"name": "Sligo", "latitude": 54.2667, "longitude": -8.48333}, {"name": "Nigeria", "latitude": 10.0, "longitude": 8.0}, {"name": "Sligo", "latitude": 54.2667, "longitude": -8.48333}, {"name": "Sligo", "latitude": 54.2667, "longitude": -8.48333}, {"name": "Sligo", "latitude": 54.2667, "longitude": -8.48333}, {"name": "Lagos", "latitude": 6.45306, "longitude": 3.39583}, {"name": "Sligo", "latitude": 54.2667, "longitude": -8.48333}, {"name": "Nigeria", "latitude": 10.0, "longitude": 8.0}, {"name": "Irish", "latitude": 53.0, "longitude": -8.0}, {"name": "Nigeria", "latitude": 10.0, "longitude": 8.0}, {"name": "Irish", "latitude": 53.0, "longitude": -8.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

SEWAGE is pouring into a river, decimating fish stocks, after a local authority ignored advice to cease allowing building on an overloaded system. Mayo County Council is sanctioning several major developments in a town, despite a warning from the planning appeal board that housing schemes should not be built until the capacity of the area's 70-year-old sewage treatment facility was improved. Ironically, a 25-house development turned down by An Bord Pleanala when it issued its warning was later granted planning permission by the council when a new application was submitted. However, no significant upgrade works on the sewage plant, which only provides primary treatment of waste waters, had taken place in the intervening period. The housing developments, a 44-bedroom hotel and a 315sq metre office building, were all sanctioned after 2000 when the board issued its warning. Although the council says it has now prioritised the upgrading of the sewage treatment plant, a row between the local authority and the Department of Environment over funding has delayed the improvements. Concerned anglers have questioned the council's planning policy and say untreated effluent is now flowing directly into the River Pollagh, a tributary of the River Moy. Before it became polluted, the Pollagh was renowned for brown trout fishing and was also an important salmon spawning river. \"It appears the council has favoured development over the environment and the past 10 to 15 years have seen the gradual decimation of fish stocks and fly hatches. \"The town can no longer avail of game angling facilities nor can we attract visiting anglers as we did in the past.\" Mayo County Council said in a statement that it was \"happy\" with its policy regarding planning in Kiltimagh. \"Serious questions need to be answered as to how almost 200 houses, a hotel and an office building could be given permission by the council after An Bord Pleanala voiced serious concerns about any future development in the town without adequate sewage treatment facilities being put in place,\" said", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Mayo County", "latitude": 53.9, "longitude": -9.25}, {"name": "River Pollagh", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "River Moy", "latitude": 54.1833, "longitude": -9.15}, {"name": "Pollagh", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, {"name": "Mayo County", "latitude": 53.9, "longitude": -9.25}, {"name": "Kiltimagh", "latitude": 53.85, "longitude": -9.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Census data released today show Platte County reaching an all-time population high of 32,072 as of July 1, 2008, an increase of 1.6 percent since the 2000 census. From 2007 to 2008, the population increased by 272 people, nearly a percentage point gain at .86 percent. The increase places Platte as the state\u2019s 10th most populous county. Overall in Nebraska, not even a third of the counties saw populations increase in 2008. The figures show 28 of Nebraska\u2019s 93 counties gained in population from July 2007 to July 2008. That\u2019s one more than in the previous year. All but one of the remaining counties lost population. Sherman County, which includes Loup City, held firm at 2,994. But an analysis from the University of Nebraska at Omaha\u2019s Center for Public Affairs Research shows changes overall were better than those seen in recent years. Small Hitchcock and Hayes counties in southwest Nebraska, for example, both gained population in the one-year period after several years of losses. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a one-year blip or something, but it\u2019s definitely interesting to see that,\u201d said UNO\u2019s David Drozd, a research associate. Dakota, Otoe and Washington counties, whose numbers typically go up, saw their populations fall. In December, the Census bureau reported the state gained 13,959 residents over the one-year period. That\u2019s the most Nebraska has seen in a dozen years. Drozd attributed the gain to people moving into Nebraska from states harder hit by the economic downturn, as well as a strong birth rate. Economic conditions also could have lured some people back to rural areas, including college students who returned to the farm, he said. \u201cBy and large, for rural areas, a lot of the commodity prices were relatively strong,\u201d he said. Several counties are seeing population levels unseen in decades. Lincoln County\u2019s population (North Platte) of 35,582 is closer than ever to its all-time high set in 1981. It needs about 220 more people to top it. Some counties that marked losses in 2008 saw their rates of decline slowing. Madison County, for example, lost just 20 people after losing hundreds after the closing of a Tyson Foods plant in 2006. The combined population of Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties continues to creep closer to the 1 million mark. They now account for 52 percent of the state\u2019s population, having more than 931,000 residents combined. In 2000, they controlled nearly 49 percent of the state\u2019s population. With the 2010 Census quickly approaching, the latest estimates confirm a timely change of course within Nebraska\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. The district that includes more than three-fourths of the state lost about 2,700 people annually in the first six years of the decade. But in 2008, it gained about 150 people. Drozd estimates its total population now sits at 551,000. Every 10 years following the census, seats in the U.S. House of Representatives must be redistributed fairly among the states. In 2000, Nebraska\u2019s slow growth sparked concern that the state could lose a seat a decade down the line. More than 70 years ago, Nebraska had six congressional districts.

COLUMBUS -- A 27-year-old Columbus woman who admitted to falsely accusing a Meadow Grove man of sexual assault in May 2008 has been fined and ordered to pay restitution for lying about the incident. Janae McMahon was fined $150 and ordered to pay $1,671 restitution on Wednesday in Platte County Court for her conviction of attempted false reporting. McMahon pleaded no contest to the reduced charge in connection with the May 28 incident after recanting her story of a sexual assault stemming from an encounter with the man she met over the Internet. The defendant, who was initially charged with false reporting, successfully completed court-ordered mental health counseling prior to her sentencing. McMahon paid the restitution for the police and medical expenses of the assault investigation late last year. Platte County Attorney Sandra Allen said she hoped the sentence imposed on McMahon didn\u2019t make law enforcement investigators \u201cgun-shy\u201d about making sexual assault arrests in the future. \u201cOn the face of it, (a fine and restitution) is not much of a deterrent to someone making a false accusation,\u2019\u2019 Allen said. On the other hand, people who falsely accuse others of crimes probably aren\u2019t deterred by the threat of punishment, she said. Defense attorney Denise Kracl said Thursday McMahon\u2019s successful completion of counseling, which her client began even before being ordered to by the court, was a factor at sentencing. The judge checked McMahon\u2019s progress and compliance with counseling requirements over several months and was \u201cvery fair\u201d in giving her that opportunity, Kracl said. \u201cThis has been a really unfortunate situation for everyone involved,\u2019\u2019 the defense attorney said. \u201cJanae is resuming her life and doing the best she can to put the whole incident behind her. This is as good of an outcome as she could have expected.\u201d False reporting is a Class I misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of one year imprisonment, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. Attempted false reporting is a Class II misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of six months in jail, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. The county attorney\u2019s office dismissed a first-degree sexual assault charge against 38-year-old Richard Pehrson II of Meadow Grove in late-June. The man faced up to 50 years in prison if convicted. McMahon later recanted her story after Pehrson underwent a polygraph examination, and she was brought in by law enforcement authorities for further questioning. Pehrson was held for about a week in the Platte County Detention Facility following his arrest. His bond was set at 10 percent of $150,000 and he was placed on unpaid administrative leave from his job as a psych tech at Faith Regional Center in Norfolk. Pehrson, who also served as a volunteer firefighter, got his job back when McMahon\u2019s lie came to light. Allen sent letters to Pehrson\u2019s employer and the fire department explaining how he had been falsely accused in the case. \u201cHe was not terribly angry,\u2019\u2019 said Allen recalling a telephone conversation with the Meadow Grove man. \u201cHe was happy to have his name cleared.\u201d Pehrson could not be reached this week for his reaction to his accuser\u2019s sentencing. The Meadow Grove man and city woman, according to court documents, met over the Internet in early-May and were corresponding by e-mail for three weeks before the incident. The two met once in a public park in Norfolk. Later in May, Pehrson was invited by McMahon to Columbus late the night of May 27 to watch a movie. In the early-morning hours of May 28, Pehrson said the two had consensual sex. In the days following the incident, McMahon sent Pehrson e-mails saying how much she missed talking to him. That\u2019s not the story McMahon initially told authorities. According to the arrest affidavit filed in the case by Columbus Investigator Gregory Sealock, the woman did invite Pehrson over to her home to watch a movie, but she later got tired and wanted to go to bed. The woman said she allowed Pehrson to sleep on her couch because he had been drinking beer and didn\u2019t want to drive to his Meadow Grove home, Sealock stated. The woman later \u201cawoke to find Pehrson in bed with her\u201d and described a sexual assault in graphic detail. Defense attorney Donna Tonderum, who represented Pehrson while serving as a deputy in the Platte County Public Defender\u2019s Office, said her former client felt \u201chumiliated by the whole experience.\u201d Tonderum said Pehrson was expecting McMahon to spend some time in the county lockup. \u201cI think he\u2019d be very disappointed by the outcome,\u201d she said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "COLUMBUS", "latitude": 41.4297, "longitude": -97.3684}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 41.4297, "longitude": -97.3684}, {"name": "Meadow Grove", "latitude": 42.0289, "longitude": -97.7339}, {"name": "Platte County", "latitude": 41.55, "longitude": -97.4837}, {"name": "Platte County", "latitude": 41.55, "longitude": -97.4837}, {"name": "Meadow Grove", "latitude": 42.0289, "longitude": -97.7339}, {"name": "Platte County", "latitude": 41.55, "longitude": -97.4837}, {"name": "Norfolk", "latitude": 42.0283, "longitude": -97.417}, {"name": "Meadow Grove", "latitude": 42.0289, "longitude": -97.7339}, {"name": "Meadow Grove", "latitude": 42.0289, "longitude": -97.7339}, {"name": "Norfolk", "latitude": 42.0283, "longitude": -97.417}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 41.4297, "longitude": -97.3684}, {"name": "Columbus", "latitude": 41.4297, "longitude": -97.3684}, {"name": "Meadow Grove", "latitude": 42.0289, "longitude": -97.7339}, {"name": "Platte County", "latitude": 41.55, "longitude": -97.4837}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

OMAHA -- A University of Nebraska sociologist says the state\u2019s waning rural population is changing the way people do business. Randy Cantrell, with the university\u2019s Rural Initiative, said in most rural counties, between 18 percent and 30 percent or more of jobs are now due to self-employment. And, that accounts for virtually all job growth in rural areas. He believes the popularity of self-employment is on the rise in rural Nebraska. Cantrell hasn\u2019t been able to put his finger on such details through his research, namely an annual rural poll that surveys rural residents on well-being, policy and work issues. But he has a theory: The rural poll is asking the wrong question. In the past, people have been asked if they have a business. Cantrell realizes that may be leaving out those who still get a paycheck from their employers, but technically are private contractors. He used the example of inbound telemarketers, who he thinks can rightfully assert they have a business. As rural areas continue to see their population numbers fall, Cantrell said he expects that to put pressure on employers to shift away from the traditional way of doing business and rely on private contractors. \u201cThere\u2019s still a demand for service but not enough to support a business of several employees,\u201d he said. Cantrell details the phenomenon and other observations about Nebraska\u2019s economic and demographic changes in a new report based on 2007 census data and other federal statistics. Census data released this week shows the state\u2019s three largest counties \u201d Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy \u201d grew by 14,240 people collectively in 2008. The remaining 90 counties declined by 281. Cantrell said he plans to revise his report with the newly released information. The rural poll will take another shot at the \u201cbusiness\u201d question this year, which is on its way to 7,000 Nebraska households. The survey is conducted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln\u2019s Center for Applied Rural Innovation in cooperation with the Rural Initiative and UNL\u2019s Department of Agricultural Economics. Cantrell\u2019s study also notes the continued decline of those under age 20 living in rural areas. All but seven counties in the state declined in this population group during this decade, he said in the report. Cherry County, for example, saw a 20 percent drop in people under age 20 between 2000 and 2007. He attributes the changes to people leaving the state \u201d likely for economic reasons \u201d and a decline in birth rates.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "OMAHA", "latitude": 41.2586, "longitude": -95.9378}, {"name": "Nebraska", "latitude": 41.5003, "longitude": -99.7507}, {"name": "Nebraska", "latitude": 41.5003, "longitude": -99.7507}, {"name": "Nebraska", "latitude": 41.5003, "longitude": -99.7507}, {"name": "Douglas", "latitude": 41.3, "longitude": -96.167}, {"name": "Lancaster", "latitude": 40.7833, "longitude": -96.6836}, {"name": "Sarpy", "latitude": 41.1, "longitude": -96.1336}, {"name": "Nebraska", "latitude": 41.5003, "longitude": -99.7507}, {"name": "Nebraska", "latitude": 41.5003, "longitude": -99.7507}, {"name": "Lincoln", "latitude": 40.8, "longitude": -96.667}, {"name": "Cherry County", "latitude": 42.55, "longitude": -101.1}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

COLUMBUS -- Most of the student musicians had never met before, and they only had a few hours to get in harmony before they would be performing together. Students from the Nebraska Centennial Conference were at Scotus Central Catholic Saturday for the honor band and vocal clinic. Several dozen students from the nine conference schools spent the morning and early afternoon practicing songs for concert held at the school later that day. Scotus had about 30 students taking part in the band and vocal concert. Guest conductors lead each of the groups. Dr. David Bohnert, director of bands at Wayne State College, lead the band, and Dr. Rhonda Fuelberth, associate professor of music education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, directed the choir. Students had been learning their respective music a few weeks prior to the clinic, but Saturday was their first time performing as a group. That is one aspect that Scotus Senior Nicholas Raimondo enjoys about the clinic. \u201cWe are all working together instead of competing against each other,\u201d Raimondo said. Students also said another part that they like about the clinic is the opportunity to perform with different directors. The instructors each brought their own unique style to the clinic. Bohnert told the students as he was directing them during practice, that he wanted them to experience what it is like performing with a large and different group of people. \u201cIf you learn nothing else today, at least learn to listen. This is where we go from 70 different individuals to one band,\u201d Bohnert said. \u201cYou have to put yourself in the big picture.\u201d Students were chosen for the clinic by their instructors and by meeting certain criteria. The host site for the event rotates between the nine schools in the conference. E.J. Gardner, vocal music director at Scotus, said the arts, especially performing arts such as band and choir, help students develop into well-rounded people. \u201cThere is a music intelligence part of the brain, just like there is a math intelligence and a science intelligence. This is a way to feed the brain,\u201d Gardner said of the clinic.

COLUMBUS -- The Lakeview Board of Education met Monday with representatives from McPherson & Jacobsen LLC to establish the major criteria they are looking for in a candidate to replace Superintendent Paul Calvert. The Omaha executive recruitment and development firm presented the five-phase approach it uses to help school districts hire administrative staff as well as a tentative calendar that includes a seven-week timeline and May 8 as the estimated date for the final decision of the board. The first phase was conducted during Monday\u2019s meeting as the board identified the five major criteria they are looking for in potential candidates. The top five skills and characteristics identified and ranked by the board, according to McPherson\u2019s tabulations, are, in order: 1. Strong fiscal skills; 2. Good communication skills; 3. Open-minded leadership; 4. Good team member and leader; 5. Extensive knowledge of local, state and federal policiesThe representatives asked each board member to identify characteristics they would like in a potential hire. Of note, \u201cthe best quality education for the kids\u201d was listed during the second time the representatives asked for each board member\u2019s ideas, but was not included in the top five based on McPherson\u2019s tabulation. After the list was compiled, it was condensed by consolidating overlapping criteria and each member was then asked to pick their top five and rank them in order. The application questions will revolve around the criteria identified, according to the McPherson representatives. Although honesty, integrity, respect and ethics were commonly listed by board members, Jerry Ehlers, lead consultant for McPherson & Jacobsen, said identifying factors for those characteristics were standard for each process. Ehlers encouraged the board to list criteria that would help them find a superintendent who would match the needs of the district and meet the challenges it faces. \u201cIt is understood if you are going to get the job you have to have those characteristics,\u201d he said. Ehlers made the board aware the district could be competing with other districts for an exceptional candidate and cautioned them not to hire a replacement just to fill the position. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t a ton of applicants out there. There are more people retiring and getting out of it then are coming through the pipeline,\u201d he said, so candidates \u201care interviewing you just as much as you\u2019re interviewing them. \u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t get a quality candidate because of the timing\u201d he advised the board to move forward with an interim superintendent for a year, Ehlers said. \u201cMr. (Glen) Morgan and I aren\u2019t hiring anybody, the patrons aren\u2019t hiring anybody, the students aren\u2019t hiring anybody. Only the six of you have a vote.\u201d At the board\u2019s request, Ehlers said the principal search to find a replacement for Bob Arp could be conducted for an additional $1,500, which would include advertising, recruitment screening and background and reference checks.

It was fairly obvious from the beginning.\" Wilson declined to say if authorities had pinpointed who died first, a motive or a weapon, or if they had found a note at the scene. Authorities said they were interviewing the Lewises' neighbors and relatives yesterday. Giaccone said the Lewises had two adult sons and other family members scattered throughout the region and country. One of their sons, Spencer Lewis of Bethel, Vt., declined to comment yesterday when reached by phone. \"I am beside myself right now,\" said Spencer Lewis, a local singer-songwriter. Giaccone said the Hanover police had no prior contact with Elliott or Barbara Lewis. \"From the police perspective, they were not generally known to us,\" Giaccone said. The Lewises' 900-square-foot condominium is part of a 55-and-over complex adjacent to the CVS parking lot in downtown Hanover. The Lewises had lived in the building for about 10 years, Giaccone said.

The man who claims that former Epsom police chief Henry Farrin assaulted him is the roommate of Farrin's former wife. Farrin, 43, was arrested March 11 on a charge of simple assault for allegedly attacking Howard Brown, 27, in the restroom of the American Legion Post 31 in Penacook. In a stalking petition filed with Concord District Court, Brown wrote that Farrin choked him and lifted him off his feet. When the charges were first publicized, neither the police nor Farrin's attorney, Tony Soltani, would say what the connection was between the two men. Since then, Brown has told the Monitor that he is a friend of Farrin's ex-wife. \"That's what I think his beef is with me,\" Brown said. Brown said he became friends with Farrin's former wife when he lived in an apartment next to the one where she was staying while going through her divorce. Brown later moved to a two-bedroom apartment and told Farrin's ex-wife that she could rent a room from him if she needed a place to stay. \"I never even sneezed in this guy's direction my entire life,\" Brown said. According to Brown's account, Brown, Farrin and Farrin's ex-wife were all at the American Legion, with separate groups of friends, on the night of March 6. Brown is not a member of the Legion, but he said he came with a colleague who is a member. Brown said he went to the bathroom, and Farrin walked in after him. As Brown was about to leave the bathroom, Farrin started speaking to him. \"All of a sudden I hear the guy say something: 'How does it feel to be a chump?' \" Brown said. \" (I said) 'Excuse me? If anyone's a chump, it's you.' \" Brown said Farrin walked toward him and asked Brown to repeat himself, which he did. \"He instantly looks at me, pins me up against a wall, picks me up off my feet,\" Brown said. Brown said he knew Farrin was a former police officer, so he did not hit him back, although he did insult Farrin verbally. \"I never touched him,\" Brown said. At that point, Brown said, a woman standing outside the door heard the scuffle and opened the door enough to see Brown pinned up against the wall. She called for help, and several men rushed into the bathroom and separated Farrin and Brown. Brown said he decided to file for a restraining order and press charges with the police because he was scared Farrin would one day hurt him or someone else. \"He's an ex-chief of a police department,\" Brown said. \"What's he doing grabbing a guy in a men's room?

A Merrimack County Superior Court judge yesterday denied a request by Concord developer Kevin Guay to have access to his properties while state officials conduct a criminal investigation into possible environmental violations. Judge Diane Nicolosi wrote, \"the State's interest in maintaining the integrity of its crime scene and investigation warrants the temporary exclusion of Mr. Guay and his lawyer from the property until the search is completed.\" Nicolosi said the search warrant is similar to grand jury proceedings, which the court has recognized as being secret. \"It is in the public's best interest for the State to work at the site unfettered and to accomplish any necessary follow up without interference from the public or a criminal defendant,\" she wrote. On Thursday morning, the Concord Police executed two search warrants and cordoned off Guay's properties at 180 Clinton St. and on Villanova Drive. The Department of Environmental Services took soil samples and began excavating. A state helicopter was involved in the action. No one except for tenants was allowed on or off the property, including Guay. At 1 p.m. yesterday, Guay's attorney Brandon Giuda filed a petition with the court asking for access to the property. \"I'd think in the U.S., which is not a police state, observation of the police's extensive intrusion into someone's property, where they're destroying by excavating, should be observed,\" Giuda told the Monitor. \"We want to see what they're doing.\" At a hearing two hours later, Lauren Noether, senior assistant attorney general for the state Justice Department's environmental protection bureau, responded that Guay should not be allowed onto the property. She argued that his presence could compromise the investigation, jeopardize the safety of officers and be a health risk. During the hearing, several new details emerged about the investigation. Detective Sgt. John Thomas of the Concord Police Department's criminal division testified that officials started work at the Villanova Drive property, which they hoped to finish yesterday evening. They planned to start work on Clinton Street today, and hoped to finish by the end of the day. According to Noether, the warrant gave state officials seven days to finish their search, but Thomas said he hoped it could be completed by tonight. \"There's a lot of money involved from the city and the state,\" Thomas said. \"We'll try to finish tomorrow, but we don't know what's in there. If we find what we're expecting to find, it could be longer.\" On the Villanova Drive property, Thomas said there was a defined \"hot zone\" where the state had dug a hole and was removing hazardous waste, and from which at least one large item was removed yesterday. Noether said there were safety concerns, since state officials do not know what is buried. \"It's not entirely clear what's going to be exposed,\" Noether said. \"If it contains something like asbestos, it can be airborne.\" Noether described the area as \"one huge pit of junk\" that is being excavated by two Department of Environmental Services officials in protective gear. She also worried there could be something explosive, like a propane tank, buried on the property. Noether also said that the area includes a \"command zone\" where DES is communicating with the police, and communications could be compromised if someone else were present At the Clinton Street site, Noether said, one \"hazardous area\" was near the driveway, just past the police barrier, where there is a septic system and leach field. Noether said Guay would be allowed back on the property once state officials stopped digging and deemed it safe.

The frozen body found earlier this week along the shore of Lake Opechee in Laconia has been identified as that of a Laconia man who went missing nearly three months ago. But the police still aren't sure how Bryan Harman, 28, died. The state medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy yesterday, identifying the body as Harman's. The autopsy found nothing suspicious - no wounds or signs of violence - and it could be months before toxicology reports come back, said Laconia police Capt. William Clary. \"There's nothing sticking out,\" Clary said. He said the autopsy also did not determine how long ago Harman had died, but \"we're saying at least several months.\" Harman was last seen on New Year's Eve. He had a fight with his girlfriend, his mother said when she called the police the next day to report him missing. The police began to investigate. Flyers were posted around Laconia. The police tracked Harman's cell phone and credit cards, but they weren't used, Clary said. Harman never picked up a paycheck from work. Months passed, and no one called to report anything, Clary said. On Wednesday, two people walking along nearby railroad tracks and searching the area for bottles spotted a body by the lake's shoreline. It was partly in the water and partly covered in ice, Clary said. The body, which was fully clothed, likely wasn't visible until recently, as snow began to melt, Clary said. The medical examiner's office took the body, and an autopsy was scheduled. Though an identification hadn't been made, Harman was the only missing person report that the Laconia police had pending, and they contacted his family to let them know a body had been found. \"We wanted to make sure they knew we were doing everything we could,\" Clary said. During the autopsy, the medical examiner was able to identify Harman with information his family had previously provided, including \"tattoos, body piercings, very good clothing description,\" Clary said. \"We had all that stuff on hand.\" Harman also had his wallet, including an ID from Alaska. Clary said Harman lived in Alaska \"for some period of time\" and said he thought Harman's father lived there also. Harman is listed as living on Dartmouth Street in Laconia. Yesterday morning, before the autopsy had been conducted, a woman answered the phone and identified herself as Harman's ex-girlfriend.

A cold drizzle fell upon the hundreds of people who gathered to say goodbye to Cpl. Michael Ouellette yesterday. They stood among gravestones at the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery in Boscawen, circling the wooden casket that held Ouellette, the 28-year-old Manchester Marine killed last week in Afghanistan. They listened as Alan Ouellette spoke of how his older brother had lived - by reaching out to people - and proposed that friends and family do the same in his memory. They watched as two Marines held an American flag over the casket and began to fold it into crisp triangles, their hands in white gloves, their movements deliberate. Marines came from far away yesterday to honor Ouellette, who was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force. He was killed March 22 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province of southwestern Afghanistan. Another Marine, Cpl. Anthony Williams, 21, of Pennsylvania, was killed the same day. The military hasn't disclosed additional details. Ouellette, who was buried with full military honors, earned seven commendations since joining the Marines in 2005. Afghanistan was his third deployment; he previously served two tours in Iraq. It was during the first tour that Lance Cpl. Christopher Escher came to know him. \"He was always a leader, even as a junior guy,\" Escher said yesterday, recalling the days they spent together on patrol in Anbar province. (\"Every day,\" he said, smiling and shaking his head slightly.) Ouellette became a team leader and then a squad leader, he said. \"He didn't even have to go on this deployment,\" said Escher, who came from Camp Lejeune, N.C., for the service. But \"the guys under him didn't have combat experience.\" Ouellette, he said, wanted to make sure they were taken care of. Ouellette is the 28th person from New Hampshire killed since 2003 while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. Flags flew at half-staff across the state yesterday. Sen. Judd Gregg mentioned Ouellette on the floor of the U.S. Senate, saying that he'd spoken to Ouellette's mother, \"and of course he was an exceptional individual.\" And Gov. John Lynch came to yesterday's ceremony, standing among the mourners after taps was played. But the crowd yesterday numbered many more than officials and Marines and members of the military. Tai Ahmad, one of Ouellette's closest friends from high school, said many of their Manchester Memorial High School classmates had come to Ouellette's wake and services to pay their respects. \"He had no problems with anybody, not one person I can recall,\" Ahmad said in a conversation last week. \"He was truly, truly, truly just genuine.\" Young men lingered in small circles long after yesterday's service had ended, giving out hugs as they patted each other on the back. They waited in line to walk past Ouellette's casket, under the tarpaulin where his family stood. Alan Ouellette, the younger brother, greeted each person with a handshake and a hug. \"Thank you so much for coming,\" he told one woman as he hugged her tightly. \"I'm proud of my family.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region KwaZulu-Natal. In an interview, he said the new variant was \"very highly troubling and alarming because of the very high fatality rate.\" Some patients might have contracted the bug in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were hospital health workers. These distressing findings urged a two-day meeting in Johannesburg to discuss the situation. Experts like Dr. Moll believe the new strain is also present in other provinces than KwaZulu-Natal. Conference organizers report cases in Mozambique and Botswana too. The World Health Organization has called for renewed efforts to combat the disease. Meanwhile, officials of the Health Ministry are suspected to be enforcing a media ban on the topics of AIDS and possibly TB.

All six have maintained their innocence throughout. They have also claimed that they suffered torture to extract confessions.

However, Libya insisted on further concessions on relations with the European Union and aid. A deal between the E.U. and Libya, mediated by Qatar, ended the diplomatic standoff. The foreign minister of Libya, Abdel Rahman Shalgham, said the E.U. promised to provide \"life-long treatment\" to the infected children, as well as aid to \"improve the Benghazi hospital\" where the children were infected.

Last Thursday, Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe announced in a televised address that the outbreak had been halted, saying that \"I am happy to say our doctors are being assisted by others, and the WHO [World Health Organization] have now arrested cholera.\" Mugabe has also accused Western powers of plotting to use the epidemic as a reason to overthrow him. \"Now that there is no cholera, there is no cause for war,\" he stated. Other Zimbabwean high-ranking officials have also blamed the United Kingdom for spreading cholera on purpose.

The animals most affected by the disease are those among waterfowl and poultry, however in recents months it has infected humans and has also been discovered in tigers as well as swine. The Nation magazine quotes WHO officials as saying that the strain has the potential of causing a human pandemic (global epidemic) resulting in tens of millions of deaths. The first appearance of this type of flu was in Hong Kong during 1997. As of July 21, 2005, one hundred and nine cases of human infection have been confirmed resulting in fifty five deaths outside of China reports the Centers for Disease Control. China has reported no deaths in the recent outbreaks, leading to speculation of a cover up. The Economist says eleven countries across Asia have been affected, and more than one hundred and twenty million birds have died from infection or been culled. Although this week a case was found in Russia making it the first European country with an infection and twelfth in the world. Usually these flu viruses are carried worldwide by wild bird populations in their intestines and are non-lethal. However this variant has mutated into the most lethal strain of influenza ever recorded says Mike Davis, author of The Monster at Our Door: The Global Threat of Avian Flu. Such occurrences are natural and have happened in the past as in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. The current virus is morphing into a type that is spread among humans with the first human-to-human cases found in Vietnam during 2005. When avian influenza subtypes adapt for this mode of transmission the effect is deadly for humans as the immune system has no natural immunities for it and the production of appropriate antibodies to fight the infection takes some time. Further complicating the effort to combat H5N1, it was reported in the Washington Post that the People's Republic of China has been administering the medication Amantadine to poultry in violation of international livestock regulations that state it is for human use only since the late-1990s (all the time officially denying any cases of bird flu among its poultry); the result has been that the virus is now largely immune to the medication and is significantly deadlier.

There are also three suspected cases of the virus infecting thoroughbreds at Randwick racecourse in Sydney, if the horses test positive to the flu they will be the first thoroughbreds to be infected with the virus. The Federal Agriculture Minister, Peter McGauran told ABC Radio this morning that while the source of the outbreak was not known, it is likely that the outbreak may have been caused by an equestrian event held in Maitland on the 18th and 19th of August. \"Everyone's been assuming it was the Centennial Park horses that travelled and infected horses in different parts of regional NSW,\" he said. \"It would appear at this stage that almost all, if not every horse affected has passed through a Maitland horse event on the weekend of the 18th and 19th, or come in contact with a Maitland horse.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Australia", "latitude": -25.0, "longitude": 133.0}, {"name": "New South Wales", "latitude": -32.16, "longitude": 147.01}, {"name": "NSW", "latitude": -32.16, "longitude": 147.01}, {"name": "Eastern Creek", "latitude": -33.79, "longitude": 150.86}, {"name": "Centennial Park", "latitude": -33.9, "longitude": 151.23}, {"name": "Sydney", "latitude": -33.86, "longitude": 151.2}, {"name": "Cattai", "latitude": -33.55, "longitude": 150.91}, {"name": "Wilberforce", "latitude": -33.55, "longitude": 150.84}, {"name": "Sydney", "latitude": -33.86, "longitude": 151.2}, {"name": "Moonbi", "latitude": -31.01, "longitude": 151.06}, {"name": "Parkes", "latitude": -33.13, "longitude": 148.16}, {"name": "Berry", "latitude": -34.77, "longitude": 150.69}, {"name": "Wyong", "latitude": -33.28, "longitude": 151.41}, {"name": "NSW", "latitude": -32.16, "longitude": 147.01}, {"name": "Warwick", "latitude": -28.21, "longitude": 152.01}, {"name": "Queensland", "latitude": -23.0, "longitude": 143.0}, {"name": "NSW", "latitude": -32.16, "longitude": 147.01}, {"name": "Brisbane", "latitude": -27.46, "longitude": 153.03}, {"name": "Victoria", "latitude": -37.0, "longitude": 144.0}, {"name": "Randwick", "latitude": -33.91, "longitude": 151.23}, {"name": "Sydney", "latitude": -33.86, "longitude": 151.2}, {"name": "Maitland", "latitude": -32.71, "longitude": 151.55}, {"name": "Centennial Park", "latitude": -33.9, "longitude": 151.23}, {"name": "NSW", "latitude": -32.16, "longitude": 147.01}, {"name": "Maitland", "latitude": -32.71, "longitude": 151.55}, {"name": "Maitland", "latitude": -32.71, "longitude": 151.55}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The United Nations has warned that the disease can not be contained. Over ninety cases of the flu have been reported throughout the world. The outbreak, which started in Mexico, has now spread across the globe, with confirmed cases having been reported in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, New Zealand and Israel. Mexican health officials have raised the death toll from the virus to 152, with at least 1,614 suspected cases being under observation. The United States also reporting its first death, a Mexican boy, visiting relatives in Texas. He had previously been in Mexico City and had had another undetermined illness prior to his arrival in the United States. Spain says it has confirmed the first case of swine flu in a person who has not travelled to Mexico. Keiji Fukuda, the chief of the UN's World Health Organisation (WHO), has said that the outbreak could possibly turn into a pandemic, and encouraged countries to \"take the opportunity to prepare\" against such a possibility. Fukuda also warned that \"containment is not a feasible operation\". At the same time, the UN chief noted that it is still too early to declare a pandemic, even with the number of new cases increasing. \"The evolution into a pandemic cannot be considered inevitable, but of course we are taking this possibility very seriously. Countries should really take this opportunity to prepare themselves for the possibility for a pandemic,\" he said. In response to the recent spread of the flu, the WHO recently raised its pandemic alert level from three to four, stopping two levels short of declaring a full pandemic. The WHO has confirmed that the disease is not transmitted from animals or meat. \"There is no danger form eating pork,\" Hartl said. \"If you cook pork well, if you cook all meat well, it kills all virus[es],\" Hartl said. In the United States, fifty people have fallen ill from swine flu. California has confirmed at least thirteen cases, three in Texas, two in Kansas, and one case in Ohio. New York has confirmed 28 incidents. The number is expected to rise, as confirmations from testing are still ongoing. \"The human swine flu outbreak continues to grow in the United States and internationally,\" said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a bulletin report. \"Today, CDC reports additional cases of confirmed swine influenza and a number of hospitalizations of swine flu patients. Internationally, the situation is more serious too, with additional countries reporting confirmed cases of swine flu.\" New Zealand officials reported that eleven of the country's residents that had recently travelled to Mexico are now showing sypmtoms of the virus. Three of the infected persons had been confirmed to have the virus, Health Minister Tony Ryall stated. The health ministry of Israel confirmed two cases of the flu in travellers. South Korea has reported a case in a tourist visiting Mexico, while Spain has recently confirmed two more incidents. Meanwhile, the situation in the epicentre of the outbreak, Mexico, is deterioriating. Mexican officials have told restaurants to serve only takeaway food, has closed schools until May 8, and placed Mexico City, the country's capital, under a high alert. Many public events have been cancelled, and masks have been given out to passengers on trains. Mexico City Health Secretary Armando Ahued stated that 6,610 people with symptoms of swine flu were admitted to hospitals on Monday, but only 29 had remained hospitalised. The WHO on Tuesday stated that it would not endorse travel bans to attempt to stop the spread of the virus. \"Border controls don't work. Screening doesn't work,\" said the WHO spokesman, Hartl, adding that infected persons may not show any symptoms of the disease when at a border crossing or airport. \"Certainly, if you feel that you are ill, you should not travel, in any case, to anywhere,\" Hartl said. Among the symptoms of the swine flu include temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, diarrhea, vomiting, and heavy coughing.

The drug resistance appears to be limited to the H1N1 variant which causes seasonal flu, while H3N2 or influenza B strains and the H5N1 strain that causes bird flu did not show increased resistance. While previous studies showed resistance levels below 1%, samples tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now showed around 5% resistance, and in a Canadian survey of 81 samples, 8 showed resistance. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found 19 cases of resistance among 148 samples from last November. Among 16 samples from Norway, 12 showed resistance. In a wider study of 437 H1N1 isolates from 19 countries, the European agency found 59 resistant samples from 9 countries. Resistance has not been shown to increase in Japan or Hong Kong. In Japan, Tamiflu is widely prescribed for seasonal flu. The WHO is now contacting national authorities to get more data on flu resistance. These viruses have acquired a mutation that makes them resistant, and the WHO statement said that a resistant strain has probably emerged spontaneously. The statement added that these mutations would most likely render Tamiflu ineffective for the prevention or treatment of flu caused by resistant H1N1 viruses.

The legislation to ban private ownership could be in place next week. Current Hong Kong legislation allows private poultry ownership of up to 20 birds.

He said that the unknown disease had symptoms similar to Yellow fever but the patients died quickly. The governor appealed for medical assistance to diagnose and help control the outbreak. The outbreak comes as hundreds of thousands of refugees return to southern Sudan after a peace deal ended conflict in the areas. The refugees are housed in crowded camps where the risk of infection is high. Hotspots in south Sudan and Darfur are experiencing a lull in the fighting that has allowed normal life to return to these areas. Meanwhile, the NGO SOS Children's Villages Sudan reports that despite the ceasefire among the warring factions in south Sudan and Darfur, people are still worried that conflict may erupt once again. SOS is also concerned about shortages in medicine and clean water in its facilities in these areas. SOS emergency relief activities have restarted in Abu Shok refugee camp in Al-Fashir, Darfur, with most of the psychologists and social workers returning to work in the psycho-social centres, an SOS release reports. Work with the patients and beneficiaries of the three centres it maintains has started once again, the release adds. The situation in SOS Children's Village Malakal is also stable, but cholera is still spreading among the residents of the area, especially children. SOS Children's Villages Sudan is providing emergency medical assistance in the form of medication for the children in the SOS Children's Village, as well as those being treated in the local children's hospital. According to the SOS release, most international organisations and NGOs have returned to work in both Darfur and Malakal, especially the World Food Programme and other UN agencies. Several NGOs, however, have not resumed activities in the conflict areas. Airplanes are flying into Darfur and Malakal, but flights to Darfur are not as regular as before the conflict and there are no scheduled flights to the area of Malakal. Telephone communications are still unstable, and co-workers from SOS Children's Villages Sudan in Khartoum are relying on satellite telephones to communicate with Darfur and Malakal. Mr. Ali Mahdi, director of SOS Children's Villages Sudan, said that despite the relative quiet in both Darfur and Malakal, people are still worried and tense regarding the situation. Co-workers at the SOS Emergency Relief Centres in Darfur and those in the SOS Children's Village Malakal are afraid of conflict breaking out again in the areas. Mr. Mahdi also said that the centres in Darfur and the SOS Children's Village in Malakal are both suffering from shortages in clean water and medication, some of which are being sent from Khartoum. During a visit to Darfur on 10 January, Mr. Ali Mahdi visited the town of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, where there is a similar refugee problem as that in Al-Fashir.

Their study was published in New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday. The mutation considered in this study was identified last year as the molecular marker of artemisinin-resistant malaria. The current study found the mutation, located in the propeller domain of a Kelch protein on human chromosome 13, predicted when parasite clearance half-life would exceed five hours with 91.8% sensitivity and 88.4% specificity \u2014 usually correct in predicting both when long half-life would occur, and when it wouldn't. OpenClinica web-based database was used for collection of data which was used to assess parasite clearance rate. The study found a six-day treatment course effective against artemisinin-resistant malaria. The standard regimen consists of three-day dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine treatment, and had a 25% rate of failure at day 42 in another recent study in Pailin, Cambodia. The prolonged regimen which includes three days of artesunate followed by three days of dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine, has shown 2% rate of failure at day 42 in the same area. Geometric mean of the half-life values were similar in two treatment groups of 60 patients each at each study site: one group received artesunate at a daily dose of 2 mg per patient's body-weight kilogram and the other 4 mg per kilogram.

Pneumonic plague is a highly infectious disease which has caused many epidemics and pandemics in history. Pneumonic plague differs from bubonic as it specifically infects the lungs. The infected lungs raise the possibility of person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is usually between two to four days, but can be as little as a few hours. The initial symptoms of headache, weakness, and coughing with hemoptysis are indistinguishable from other respiratory illnesses. Without diagnosis and treatment the infection can be fatal in one to six days; mortality in untreated cases may be as high as 95%. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics.

Chad, which shares part of its eastern border with Sudan, has been the recipient of refugees fleeing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan. In addition to the estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees it manages, Chad now has an estimated 150,000 internally displaced persons, or IDPs, fleeing from attacks on villages in the eastern region where the government of Chad has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims was supported in the past by Sudan. The Chadian IDPs are set up in rudimentary camps, lacking basic necessities such as food, water and proper shelter. According to a May, 2007 report by MSF's research and epidemiological survey centre, 20 percent of children in camps near Goz Beida were suffering from acute malnutrition and \"catastrophic\" mortality rates. MSF complained of obstacles encountered in their effort to provide medical assistance to the needy. \"In Goz Beida, the IDPs receive three to eight litres of water per person per day, whereas they should have 20 litres,\" said Franck Joncret, MSF Head of Mission in Chad. Approximately 100 children are receiving treatment for malnutrition, while MSF estimated the number of acutely malnourished children to be greater than 2,000. \"This policy of rationed aid for IDPs is unacceptable,\" complained Joncret. In April, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) initiated a three month intervention for the Chadian camps, which MSF described as \"inadequate\".

In the near term, MSF anticipated an increase in malaria and epidemic diarrhoeal diseases along with an dramatic increase in malnutrition cases.

Health officials are referring to the event as the worst outbreak of the cough in 60 years. A spokesman from the California Department of Public Health, Michael Sicilia, says all of the deaths occurred in infants under three months and that nine of the deaths were found in infants under eight weeks old. This leads to the conclusion that the children were too young to receive the vaccine for the disease. Sicilia indicated that an estimated 50% of children received the disease from parents or caregivers. Earlier in July of this year California recommended that anyone over seven years old who was not fully vaccinated for Pertussis get a Tdap pertussis booster. Some parents are refusing to have their children vaccinated against the disease and the vaccine has worn off in some adults. Alison Patti, a spokesperson from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), pointed out that the vaccine does not protect individuals indefinitely and health officials are urging that people get the vaccine again if they have not received it within the past five years. According to the CDC, for the first week or two the symptoms of the cough are similar to the common cold; soon after the child begins to \"cough violently and rapidly, over and over, until the air is gone from their lungs and they're forced to inhale with a loud 'whooping' sound.\" Pertussis carries side effects, such as a 20 percent chance of pneumonia and about a one percent chance of convulsions, which makes it very deadly to infants. Doctors and parents often miss the symptoms of whooping cough in infants under six months old due to the absence of the \"whooping\" sound. Alison Patti said that the \"whooping\" characteristic is absent in adults which makes them think they don't have pertussis.

The debate about the controversial programs came on the heels of an HIV outbreak in southern Indiana. Austin, in Scott County, Indiana, was the epicenter of the outbreak. The number of new HIV positive cases in Scott County in this outbreak rose past 140. Governor Pence declared the outbreak a public health emergency on March 26, and at the same time approved a 30-day needle exchange program. Pence since offered a 30-day extension as the number of HIV positive cases continued to rise. Needle exchange programs provide clean needles in exchange for dirty needles. The sharing of dirty needles has been linked to the outbreak. Experts like Chris Beyrer, president of the International AIDS Society, support needle exchange programs. Beyrer told the Indianapolis Star, however, that temporary measures, like the one Pence implemented on March 26, don't solve the long-term problem. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommend needle exchange programs. But experts say long-term needle exchange programs are needed. The HIV epidemic in southern Indiana has been linked to a drug problem in Scott County. HIV and Hepatitis C are blood-borne viruses that spread by way of bodily fluids and bloodstream injections, especially when more than one person is using the same needle. Legislators on the committee responsible for Senate Bill 461 heard testimony last week before voting. Representative Thomas Washburne, Republican, Evansville, told Wikinews on April 27 that he was involved in conversations pertaining to needle exchange programs. \"I am inclined to follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control in implementing needle exchanges,\" Washburne said in an interview with Wikinews. \"My vote against Senate Bill 461 was not due to the needle exchanges, but other issues involved in the bill.\" House members passed the bill 80\u201319, senators 38\u201311. After legislators passed the bill, Pence told WISH-TV: \"From my perspective, the focus needs to be on health emergencies. I have throughout my career not supported needle exchanges as anti-drug policies. But with regard to addressing an epidemic, which is what we\u2019ve seen in Scott County, which is unprecedented in any rural part of the country. I was prepared to support that through executive action.\" Louisville, Kentucky, about 35 miles south of Austin, was the first Kentucky municipal government to approve a needle exchange program. The Louisville Metro Council voted 22\u20130 to approve the program on April 23. That approval requires reconsulting the council before actually implementing such a program. About 195 cities in the United States have adopted similar programs. Dr. William Shaffner, a doctor and chair of the Department of Preventative Medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, told Wikinews reporters March 25 at the University of Southern Indiana in Evansville, the day before Pence declared the public health emergency, such a program would make sense. He said the best course of action would be to \"block and tackle.\" \"Needle exchange programs ought to be used,\" Shaffner said. \"They have been proven to work and do not cause an increase in drug use.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Indiana", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -86.0}, {"name": "Indiana", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -86.0}, {"name": "Austin", "latitude": 38.74, "longitude": -85.8}, {"name": "Scott County", "latitude": 38.69, "longitude": -85.74}, {"name": "Indiana", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -86.0}, {"name": "Scott County", "latitude": 38.69, "longitude": -85.74}, {"name": "Indiana", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -86.0}, {"name": "Scott County", "latitude": 38.69, "longitude": -85.74}, {"name": "Evansville", "latitude": 37.97, "longitude": -87.55}, {"name": "Scott County", "latitude": 38.69, "longitude": -85.74}, {"name": "Louisville", "latitude": 38.22, "longitude": -85.74}, {"name": "Kentucky", "latitude": 37.5, "longitude": -85.0}, {"name": "Austin", "latitude": 38.74, "longitude": -85.8}, {"name": "Kentucky", "latitude": 37.5, "longitude": -85.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Nashville", "latitude": 36.16, "longitude": -86.78}, {"name": "Tennessee", "latitude": 36.0, "longitude": -86.0}, {"name": "Evansville", "latitude": 37.97, "longitude": -87.55}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The tissue taken was typically skin, bone and tendon, which was then sold for use in procedures such as dental implants and hip replacements. According to authorities, millions of dollars were made by selling the body parts to companies for use in operations done at hospitals and clinics in the United States and Canada. A New Jersey company, Biomedical Tissue Services, has reportedly been taking body parts from funeral homes across Brooklyn, New York. According to ABC News, they set up rooms like a \"surgical suite.\" After they took the bones, they replaced them with PVC pipe. This was purportedly done by stealth, without approval of the deceased person or the next of kin. 1,077 bodies were involved, say prosecuters. Investagators say a former dentist, Michael Mastromarino, is behind the operation. Biomedical was considered one of the \"hottest procurement companies in the country,\" raking in close to $5 million. Eventually, people became worried: \"Can the donors be trusted?\" A tissue processing company called LifeCell answered no, and issued a recall on all their tissue. Cooke's daughter, Susan Cooke Kittredge, said, \"To know his bones were sold was one thing, but to see him standing truncated before me is another entirely.\" Now thousands of people around the country are receiving letters warning that they should be tested for infectious diseases like HIV or hepatitis.

As of July 8, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1013 confirmed infections throughout the United States, along with four cases in Canada. 203 hospitalizations have been linked to the outbreak. It has caused at least one death, and it may have been a contributing factor in another. The pathogen responsible is the rare Saintpaul strain of Salmonella enterica. Nearly half of the reported illnesses were in Texas and New Mexico. According to unnamed sources close to the investigation, most illness clusters in the outbreak involve Mexican restaurants. Illness clusters in the hard hit state of Illinois were publicly identified by local health departments as involving three Mexican restaurants. The CDC is in the process of investigating the outbreak and trying to identify the contamination's point of origin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently suspects that the contaminated food product is an ingredient in fresh salsa, such as fresh jalape\u00f1o pepper, fresh serrano pepper, fresh cilantro, or certain types of raw tomato. Some produce industry insiders doubt that fresh produce is to blame for the outbreak. They point to the absence of Salmonella on all of the tested produce samples to date, as well as divergent results from produce tracebacks. They also say that the extended time frame of new sicknesses makes it unlikely that either raw tomatoes or fresh jalape\u00f1os, the government's two main suspects, could be responsible. Will Steele, President and CEO of Frontera Produce, said that \"the outbreak is probably related to processed goods and they\u2019re looking in the wrong closets.\" Steele's Texas based company has been forced to hold shipments of fresh jalape\u00f1o peppers after loads of produce were repeatedly flagged by the FDA for testing. Although independent testing of both loads showed no sign of Salmonella, the peppers are still on hold until the FDA finishes its own testing of the second load flagged on July 1st. \"There are still no results,\" Steele says. \"The salability of that produce in two to three days is gone. We ceased harvesting. There is no sense in bringing in more product and having it rot.\" Steele, like others in the produce industry, believes that the FDA should be focusing on processed produce instead of fresh produce. \"Methodology is backward,\" he says. \"FDA is reaching for answers. You can\u2019t tie jalape\u00f1o pepper shipped on June 30 back to April 10.\" Still, the FDA and the CDC consider testing of fresh jalape\u00f1os and other fresh produce a high priority. The CDC writes that \"the accumulated data from all investigations indicate that jalape\u00f1o peppers caused some illnesses.\" The FDA is cautioning that people who would be in the most danger if infected with Salmonella (infants, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems) should avoid eating the suspected types of produce listed on their website.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -95.0}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "New Mexico", "latitude": 34.0, "longitude": -106.0}, {"name": "Illinois", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -89.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.0, "longitude": -100.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The FDA was aware two weeks ago that the outbreak could be tied to melons, and linked the outbreak to the Honduran supplier on Friday. On Sunday, Honduran President Manuel Zelaya called the FDA alert \"extreme and imprudent\", and noted that the contamination from the cantaloupes was on the peel and that they could have come into contact with the bacteria after leaving Honduras. He said the United States did not present evidence that the bacteria originated in Honduras. President Zelaya told reporters: \"It's unjust that the (U.S.) has declared a unilateral health alert without any laboratory or clinical tests.\" Fredys Cerrato, Trade Minister of Honduras called on the FDA to publicize details of its studies on the affected cantaloupe, and told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol: \"This is causing us direct economic damage.\" Foodborne illness caused by Salmonella bacteria can lead to symptoms including nausia, diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps.

The FDA issued a recall on Wednesday on food items with peanut paste and other peanut products made after January 1, 2007 at a Peanut Corp. of America (PCA) center in Blakely, Georgia. The recall affects over 430 products containing peanut paste or peanut butter from the PCA plant. U.S. federal inspectors stated salmonella was found in 12 instances at the plant. So far the incident has been linked to eight deaths, with over 500 individuals sickened from the tainted products. U.S. Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) has announced he will hold a Congressional hearing February 11 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee to investigate the matter. According to an FDA report, peanut products from the Georgia plant returned to the United States after being exported were prevented from reentering the country in September due to containing \"filthy, putrid or decomposed substance, or is otherwise unfit for food,\" but the products were not tested by federal inspectors. According to the FDA, peanut products were shipped from the PCA facility though the company knew they were contaminated. PCA asserted it was unaware products were contaminated before being shipped, and released a statement saying it had \"taken extraordinary measures to identify and recall all products that have been identified as presenting a potential risk\". The PCA plant has since been shut down after state and federal inspectors discovered mold, roaches, a leaky roof, and other issues at the facility. Multiple members of Congress have made critical statements about the FDA regarding the incident. \"The FDA failing to follow up after this incident, does that mean that products that are not good enough for a foreign country are still good enough for the USA?\" said Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. \"If the FDA discovered that there was an issue with this product inspection, why didn't they follow up on it? Why didn't they take a closer look at this facility?\" asked Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT). Representative DeLauro called the actions of PCA \"reprehensible and criminal\". Beth Falwell, daughter of PCA's founder Hugh Parnell, told WSLS-TV, the NBC affiliate in Roanoke, Virginia, in a statement Thursday that her brother Stewart Parnell who currently runs the company would not knowingly harm his customers. She believes the FDA report documenting poor conditions at the PCA facility contains inaccuracies. Stewart Parnell did not respond to repeated attempts by The News & Advance for a comment.

Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico, New York, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Idaho, Connecticut, Kentucky and Utah all report human cases of the illness linked to the contaminated spinach. All individuals sickened by the outbreak have the same strain, E. coli O157:H7. Officials are currently investigating cases in Washington, Pennsylvania and California to determine if the new cases are linked to the current outbreak. \"Based on the current information, FDA advises that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach at this time. Individuals who believe they may have experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach are urged to contact their health care provider,\" said a statement on the Food and Drug Administration's website. Health officials report that the symptoms from eating any contaminated spinach are kidney failure or Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [HUS] which can occur easily in children and elderly people, bloody diarrhea, mild fever and in some cases death. At least 14 of the infected have suffered kidney failure. \"Given the severity of this illness and the seriousness of the outbreak, FDA believes that a warning to consumers is needed. We are working closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and state and local agencies to determine the cause and scope of the problem,\" added the statement. Consumers are urged to throw out any fresh spinach they may have as washing it does not help, but officials say that cooking the spinach could kill the bacteria though officials still urge consumers to throw out all spinach. \"We are telling everyone to get rid of fresh bagged spinach right now. Don't assume anything is over,\" said Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle. Wisconsin has seen the worst of the outbreak with one death reported and over 30 people infected. \"If you wash it, it is not going to get rid of it,\" said the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition director, Robert Brackett. Health officials also say that they do not know what caused the contamination and do not know where the spinach originated from. Officials believe that the contamination was not \"deliberate.\" \"It is too early to say where the spinach has come from. This is an active investigation and we will provide more information as it becomes available. We have no evidence that this was deliberate,\" said a spokeswoman for the FDA, Laura Alvey. A company which produces natural foods in California is suspected to be the source of the illness. Natural Selection Foods LLC. located in San Juan Bautista, California has recalled all of their spinach voluntarily, including any food items containing the vegetable. Some of those infected with the illness have reported eating spinach which came from the company, but officials say that the outbreak may not be entirely isolated to just Natural Selection and that the investigation into the origin of the outbreak is still ongoing. Natural Selection sells many different brand names of spinach including Dole, Trader Joe's, Green Harvest, Ready Pac, Earthbound Farm, Rave Spinach and their own brand of spinach, Natural Selections. Officials say that more cases are expected to be reported, but many individuals will recover from the illness within a week.

In a CBC interview, Dunn explains that, \"all the babies who developed infections have been successfully treated, but we were not able to completely prevent the spread of the organism from one baby to another.\" New patients will have to be diverted to other facilities in the province of Ontario or even out of country. Buffalo, New York in the United States may be a potential destination for some women in Ontario with high-risk pregnancies or premature babies. According to a Sunnybrook press release, the High Risk Perinatal Service will remain closed until there are no new transmissions of the Staphylococcus aureus bacterium. It further explains that outbreaks in the NICU are rare and that several measures have been put in place to keep the bacterium from spreading. The hospital has isolated babies who have symptoms and are ensuring that a specific team of clinicians only treat the affected babies.

Unlike more-deadly strains of Ebola virus, Philippine health officials say this particular strain, known as the Reston ebolavirus, has never caused human illness or death, and it's not immediately clear there is a public-health issue. A 22-member team of experts from three United Nations agencies arrived in Manila on Tuesday for a joint risk assessment on the virus contamination of local swine, to help the government contain the outbreak. The mission will coordinate with the Philippine counterparts - the Departments of Agriculture and Health. According to chief veterinary officer, Davinio P. Catbagan, six of 28 swine samples tested positive for Ebola-Reston by the U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory. The infected pigs came from two commercial and two backyard farms in three provinces north of Manila. Both Ebola and related Marburg hemorrhagic fever, are considered to infect humans via primates. The Straits Times reported that as of December, about 6,000 pigs at Pandi, Bulacan and Talavera farms had tested positive for the Ebola-Reston virus. \"Eating pork remained safe as long as it is handled and cooked properly (at a minimum of 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit) and bought in outlets accredited by the government's National Meat Inspection Service,\" said a joint statement by the World Health Organisation (WHO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). \"Our teams are doing field and laboratory investigation to determine where the Ebola-Reston virus came from and how it was transmitted,\" Caroline-Anne Coulombe, WHO risk communications officer, explained. According to FAO team leader, Juan Lubroth, it was the first time that the Ebola-Reston virus strain had infected animals other than monkeys and the first recorded worldwide in swine. The U.N. mission is scheduled to perform 10 days scientific tests, on two hog farms in Manaoag, Pangasinan and Pandi, Bulacan, but it would take months to publish evaluation reports on the virus. As early as May, a high incidence of swine sickness and death in three provinces caused Philippine authorities in August to send samples from the dead pigs to the NY Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The results found the presence of several diseases, including Ebola Reston virus and PRRS. In late October laboratory tests confirmed that pigs in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan farms were infected with the Ebola-Reston virus and the highly virulent strain of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRS). In early 2007 pigs on those farms died at a faster rate than usual amid the conducted lab tests. PRRSV, or Blue-Ear Pig Disease, is a viral and economically important pandemic disease which causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. Initially referred to as 'mystery swine disease' or 'mystery reproductive syndrome', it was first reported in 1987 in North America and central Europe. The disease costs the United States swine industry around $600 million annually. In December, the Philippine health authorities conducted testing of about 10,000 swine in two northern Luzon quarantined farms. Reuters reported that \"the Ebola-Reston virus in some pigs in two commercial farms and two backyard farms in the Philippines were discovered by accident in United States laboratory tests in September, when samples were sent to test another disease.\" Ebola virus is one of at least 18 known viruses capable of causing the viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome. It is the common term for a group of viruses belonging to genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, and for the disease which they cause, Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The virus is named after the Ebola River where the first recognized outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever occurred in 1976. The viruses are characterized by long filaments and have a similar shape to the Marburg virus, also in the family Filoviridae, and share similar disease symptoms. Since its discovery, Ebolavirus has been responsible for a number of deaths. In the central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the highly contagious Ebola virus was first detected in September, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres. \"As of Tuesday January 7, a total of 42 patients have been reported with suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the province of Western Kasai. 13 of these 42 patients suspected of having Ebola have died,\" it said. The Reston ebolavirus is suspected of being either another subtype of the Ebola or a new filovirus of Asian origin. It was first discovered in crab-eating macaques originating in the Philippines, from Hazleton Laboratories (now Covance) in 1989. This discovery attracted significant media attention and led to the publication of The Hot Zone. There was then, an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever among monkeys imported from the Philippines to Reston, Virginia. The Ebola-Reston strain was discovered among Philippine monkeys in the U.S. again in 1990 and 1996, and in Italy in 1992. According to the World Health Organization, African strains kill 50 percent to 90 percent of those infected through lethal bleeding and organ failure. \u201cSince the 1970s, scientists, veterinarians, microbiologists and physicians have been looking at thousands of species to see if they can find this elusive reservoir, and we have been pretty much empty-handed,\u201d Juan Lubroth, head of infectious diseases in the animal health unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, explained. Despite its status as a Level-4 organism, the Reston ebolavirus is non-pathogenic to humans and is only mildly fatal to monkeys; the perception of its lethality was skewed due to the monkey's coinfection with Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). During the incident in which it was discovered, six animal handlers eventually became seroconverted, one of whom had cut himself while performing a necropsy on the liver of an infected monkey. When the handler failed to become ill, it was concluded that the virus had a very low pathogenicity to humans. In January 1997, The Philippines Department of Environment and Natural Resources had ordered the immediate slaughter of some 600 monkeys in Ferlite, a breeding farm in Laguna, to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola Reston strain virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had donated 8,000 test kits to diagnose the ebola reston strain. \"I am more concerned in the international community because we have proven in our December sales that this ebola did not affect consumer confidence,\" Albert R. T. Lim, president of the National Federation of Hog Farmers, Inc., warned. The Philippines Department of Agriculture (DA) has directed the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and the National Meat Inspection Commission (NMIC) to conduct swine tests in South Cotabato using the US test kits for the Ebola Reston virus, before approval of the \"Meat in a Box\" shipment to Singapore. The initial export of the meat for December was deferred pending outcome of the ERV tests. Meanwhile, in eight Barangays of Santa Maria, Davao del Sur, in Mindanao, at least 50 pigs died since December due to viral and bacterial infections. Dr. Nestor Barroga, provincial veterinarian, said that he could not however detect yet the type of the infecting virus. The village of Pongpong had the largest number of casualties. Mercy Olalo, a hog raiser, said their pigs would suddenly become weak and eventually die. \"The pigs developed red skins and they salivate excessively,\" she said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Philippines", "latitude": 13.0, "longitude": 122.0}, {"name": "Manila", "latitude": 14.58, "longitude": 121.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Manila", "latitude": 14.58, "longitude": 121.0}, {"name": "Pandi", "latitude": 14.87, "longitude": 120.95}, {"name": "Bulacan", "latitude": 15.0, "longitude": 121.08}, {"name": "Talavera", "latitude": 15.58, "longitude": 120.91}, {"name": "Manaoag", "latitude": 16.04, "longitude": 120.48}, {"name": "Pangasinan", "latitude": 15.92, "longitude": 120.33}, {"name": "Pandi", "latitude": 14.87, "longitude": 120.95}, {"name": "Bulacan", "latitude": 15.0, "longitude": 121.08}, {"name": "NY", "latitude": 43.0, "longitude": -75.0}, {"name": "Plum Island", "latitude": 41.18, "longitude": -72.19}, {"name": "Nueva Ecija", "latitude": 15.58, "longitude": 121.0}, {"name": "Bulacan", "latitude": 15.0, "longitude": 121.08}, {"name": "North America", "latitude": 54.77, "longitude": -105.64}, {"name": "Europe", "latitude": 51.0, "longitude": 17.5}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Luzon", "latitude": 16.0, "longitude": 121.0}, {"name": "Philippines", "latitude": 13.0, "longitude": 122.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Democratic Republic of Congo", "latitude": -2.88, "longitude": 23.65}, {"name": "DRC", "latitude": -2.88, "longitude": 23.65}, {"name": "Western Kasai", "latitude": -5.9, "longitude": 22.45}, {"name": "Philippines", "latitude": 13.0, "longitude": 122.0}, {"name": "Philippines", "latitude": 13.0, "longitude": 122.0}, {"name": "Reston", "latitude": 38.95, "longitude": -77.34}, {"name": "Virginia", "latitude": 37.5, "longitude": -79.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Italy", "latitude": 43.0, "longitude": 12.0}, {"name": "Rome", "latitude": 41.9, "longitude": 12.5}, {"name": "Laguna", "latitude": 14.17, "longitude": 121.33}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Philippines", "latitude": 13.0, "longitude": 122.0}, {"name": "South Cotabato", "latitude": 6.17, "longitude": 125.0}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Singapore", "latitude": 1.3, "longitude": 103.8}, {"name": "Santa Maria", "latitude": 6.55, "longitude": 125.46}, {"name": "Davao del Sur", "latitude": 6.33, "longitude": 125.5}, {"name": "Mindanao", "latitude": 8.0, "longitude": 125.0}, {"name": "Pongpong", "latitude": 6.49, "longitude": 125.46}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

So far the virus only appears to have infected horses in NSW and Queensland, with 51 confirmed cases and another 400 suspected.

Racing Victoria has also said the Melbourne Cup will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak, even if no interstate or international horses can attend. Despite fines of up to $44,000 and 12 months imprisonment in NSW there have been reports that more than 100 horse owners have been caught moving their horses. The NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald, said it was \"absolutely vital that no-one moves a horse in this state\". \"We will be working with police to ensure horses are at a standstill,\" he said.

The disease is now present in seven of Angola's provinces, the latest outbreak occurring in Zaire province with six cases. The proportion of deaths in this outbreak was unusually high.

WHO officials say their goal is to expand immunization coverage and raise awareness of the importance of vaccines, and that such cross-border activities can prevent disease and save lives. WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein says that many countries are working to eliminate measles, adding that says countries in the European region are very concerned that they have stalled in their goal of eliminating measles and rubella this year. \"In European countries, in many of them, immunization coverage is below the 95 percent recommended level. And, there have been ongoing measles outbreaks in some of these countries. Measles cases have also been imported to the US and Canada and the Americas from European countries,\" said Epstein. The agency says an important goal of the immunization campaigns is to reach those who have been excluded up to now. It notes that every year, in the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean, 25 percent of deaths among children under age five are attributed to vaccine preventable diseases. 2.1 million children in the Middle East hadn't received a shot against tetanus, whooping cough, or diphteria in 2009, according to the WHO. In the Americas, WHO says special regional events are being held in border areas of Nicaragua, between Suriname and French Guiana, and between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It says many young children, pregnant women, elderly and indigenous peoples live in isolated areas where vaccine coverage is low. In all three regions, Epstein said the vaccination campaigns will be accompanied by health information campaigns. \"The biggest obstacle to reaching our goals of vaccination are lack of awareness, lack of information and people being ignorant that they should be vaccinated, and thus not having enough vaccinators, money, trucks, bicycles, etc. to get to these remote regions,\" he said.

A relatively new term - \"Colony Collapse Disorder\" is being used to describe this poorly understood phenomenon. Colony Collapse Disorder (or CCD) is a syndrome evidenced by massive die-off affecting an entire insect population. The cause of the syndrome is not yet well understood. CCD may be caused by mites or associated diseases or unknown pathogens. CCD is possibly linked to pesticide use though several studies have found no common environmental factors between unrelated outbreaks studied. According to Dennis van Engelsdorp, a bee specialist with the Pennsylvania State Department of Agriculture, \"We are pretty sure, but not certain, that it is a contagious disease.\" Honey-bees are responsible for approximately one third of the United States crop pollination including such species as: peaches, soybeans, apples, pears, pumpkins, cucumbers, cherries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries. From 1971 to 2006, approximately one half of the U.S. honey-bee colonies vanished. The rate of attrition reached new proportions in the year 2006, which were alarming to many farmers and honey-bee scientists. At least eleven different states as well as portions of Canada are known to have been affected by colony collapse disorder. The disorder has been identified in a geographically diverse group of states including Georgia, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and California. In some states the loss of honey-bee colonies is estimated as high as 75 percent of the population. The phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey-bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value is $US 1.5 billion. Total U.S. crops that are wholly dependent on the honey-bee are known to exceed $US 15 billion. In a related development on January 17, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has drastically tightened use rules on some of the chief pesticides used on apples, blueberries, grapes, peaches, pears and other fruits pollenized by honey-bees. Citing general environmental protection and farmworker safety, the EPA recently announced the tightening of use or phaseout of the highly toxic pesticides phosmet and Azinphos methyl. Under these rule changes the use of these organophosphate pesticide would be allowed continued use for five years but have somewhat reduced dosage limits.

The World Health Organisation reports that there are 8,829 confirmed cases in forty countries, most of them in Mexico and the United States. 76 people have been confirmed dead from the influenza. Many countries, among them China, Japan, and the United Kingdom, have warned the WHO to be cautious about declaring a global pandemic. They say that such an announcement, if delivered prematurely, could cause mass panic and confusion. WHO director Margaret Chan said that the organisation had listened to the countries' concerns, and will not raise the pandemic alert level from five to six, on a scale of one to six. A transition to the sixth level means that the disease is circulating actively on at least two continents. \"On 29 April, I raised the level of pandemic influenza alert from phase 4 to phase 5. We remain in phase 5 today. This virus may have given us a grace period, but we do not know how long this grace period will last. No one can say whether this is just the calm before the storm,\" Chan said at the WHO's annual meeting. However, she added that the disease could possibly pose a very serious threat to the world's population. \"I strongly urge the international community to use this grace period wisely. I strongly urge you to look closely at anything and everything we can do, collectively, to protect developing countries from, once again, bearing the brunt of a global contagion.\" \"A new influenza virus with great pandemic potential, the new influenza A (H1N1) strain, has emerged,\" Chan said. Chan said the WHO hadn't yet told antiviral manufacturers to start producing a specific vaccine for this specific strain of the virus. She urged countries to be careful and not squander their medical supplies, saying that \"manufacturing capacity for antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines is finite and insufficient for a world with 6.8 billion inhabitants. \"It is absolutely essential that countries do not squander these precious resources through poorly targeted measures,\" Chan said. Estimates by the WHO suggest that as many as two billion doses of vaccine could be produced per year if needed, although the first ones would not be available for four months to half a year. UK Secretary of Health Alan Johnson said the organisation needs to have more flexibility in its pandemic alert levels to take into consideration how severe the virus is. \"We need more time \u2013 we need to give you more time. My proposal is that you should have more flexibility. A pandemic describes the geographic spread rather than its severity and it's very important that that is reflected in your ability to move to phase six,\" he said.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "Japan", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 136.0}, {"name": "United Kingdom", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "UK", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Neither FDA nor USDA has uncovered any evidence of harm to the swine from the contaminated feed,\" added the statement.

Their study follows a recent African outbreak of the disease this parasite causes. The discovery is expected to help develop a cure preventing future deaths. The 1998\u20132001 sleeping sickness epidemics in South Sudan, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda caused tens of thousands of deaths. The parasites are spread by tsetse flies. It is considered one of the worst epidemics in the last five decades. As WHO reported, subsequent recent introduction of population screening in rural areas and distribution of more effective drugs had potentially reduced the number of death incidents. However, the main effect of these measures being a decrease in spreading of the parasite and not in decrease of the death rate, the researchers decided to tackle the puzzle. The scientists studied the molecules the human immune system activates in response to the attack. They were looking for the way the parasites inhibit it and lead to the death of the victim. Of the several known parasite species, the two that can infect humans were chosen to study, called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense. Several others also exist, but they affect only animals. Researchers knew that the Trypanosoma attacks typically are repelled by an HDL, more specifically trypanosome lytic factor-1 (TLF-1). It is generated in the humans' immune system and is toxic to the parasites but not to humans. It was known that one of the parasites, T. b. rhodensiense, has evolved an inhibitor of the toxic chemical, called Serum Resistance Associated (SRA) protein. However the other one, T. b. gambiense, was responsible for over 95% of human deaths, and it had been previously unknown why. The study showed that a gene mutation has lead to a change in the parasite's surface protein receptor. It doesn't bind to TLF-1 as well as for other species, leading to a substantial decrease in TLF-1 uptake by the parasite. The receptor is more strict, causing a lower nutrient intake as well, but it suffices, and the parasite defends against the human immune system. As professor and head of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at UGA (and one of the leaders of the research) Stephen Hajduk explained, \"Humans have evolved TLF-1 as a highly specific toxin against African trypanosomes by tricking the parasite into taking up this HDL because it resembles a nutrient the parasite needs for survival. But T. b. gambiense has evolved a counter measure to these human 'Trojan horses' simply by barring the door and not allowing TLF-1 to enter the cell, effectively blocking human innate immunity and leading to infection and ultimately disease.\" Based on the results of the research, humans could possibly develop a defense mechanism to keep the parasites from evading the human defense system. Stephen Hajduk commented, \"We believe this research represents a paradigm shift and causes us to think more broadly about how pathogens avoid host defense mechanisms. It turns out that African trypanosomes have evolved a diversity of ways to avoid human innate and acquired immune systems.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Georgia", "latitude": 33.0, "longitude": -83.5}, {"name": "Glasgow", "latitude": 55.85, "longitude": -4.25}, {"name": "South Sudan", "latitude": 8.0, "longitude": 30.0}, {"name": "Angola", "latitude": -12.5, "longitude": 18.5}, {"name": "Democratic Republic of Congo", "latitude": -2.88, "longitude": 23.65}, {"name": "Uganda", "latitude": 1.0, "longitude": 32.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) appealed for US$2.8 million to help more than 300,000 refugees in two camps in Kenya threatened by flooding. The agency explained that the mainly Somali refugees in Kenya's overcrowded Dadaab camps urgently need to be protected from the worst effects of the torrential rains. Most of Kenya is suffering from the effects of the prolonged drought; however, along the Indian Ocean coast and the northeastern region of the country, people are being pounded by torrential rainfall. UN refugee spokesman Andrej Mahecic said many of those affected by the flooding are Somali refugees living in Kenya's overcrowded Dadaab camps. \"We fear that the looming El Nino phenomenon a change in the atmosphere and ocean of the tropical Pacific region that produces floods, droughts and other weather disturbances in many regions of the world-may now threaten the 338,000 mostly Somali refugees in the two camps, which in any case usually are flooded for three months every year,\" he said. Although the yearly floods are predictable, Mahecic commented that the UNHCR is limited in what it can do ahead of time to protect the refugees from their destructive impact. Mahecic says the UNHCR began digging trenches and placing sandbags around hospitals, bore holes and other strategic locations in both camps, when heavy rains started three weeks ago. Without these and other measures, he says many sections of the camps would have been inundated. \"We are also preparing to locate to higher ground within the camps refugees who might be worst affected by the floods, particularly the chronically ill, disabled people, the elderly and children and teenagers on their own,\" he stated. When asked why camps were built on areas prone to flooding, he replied that the government allocated the areas. \"There is very little choice on where you can put a camp,\" he added.

Representatives from the City of Santa Ana, the Santa Ana Unified School District, and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) were available to answer the community's questions. Senator Dunn started off the meeting by thanking the panelists and parents for showing their support by attending. \"We are trying to address a very, very important issue. What's the issue? We have high rates of cancer, leukemia, and respiratory problems in our children. Why are our kids sick? This is a very difficult question,\" he said. \"What's causing the sickness in our children, and how can we avoid it? We can all agree that no one wants to see another sick child in Santa Ana.\" The audience applauded. \"Three weeks ago, we heard from two parents and a teacher, they told us about some deaths.\" The previous town hall meeting was held to address concerns of the community about a steel plating manufacturing plant that applied to the AQMD for a permit to expand its facilities to increase pollution emissions. Parents and teachers were concerned over the facts that the plant was located directly adjacent to Kennedy Elementary School, and that their children were experiencing high levels of lead, respiratory problems, excessive nose-bleeding, and leukemia. \"How many businesses in Santa Ana are required to obtain permits for emissions of hazardous pollutants?\" This question Dunn posed at the last meeting was answered by the AQMD and the Orange County Sanitation District, who provided maps of Santa Ana with green flags indicating where businesses with emissions permits were located. \"I can tell you one thing, at the end of the meeting, we won't have all of the answers... but we'll certainly have another Town Hall meeting. Initial concerns were raised when five boys attending Franklin Elementary were diagnosed with the same type of leukemia in Spring 2002. Attempts to gain an investigation from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) into possible causes were not successful as the Center told parents that the cases \"were in an acceptable range\". Parents, teachers, public officials, and doctors remain unconvinced. In the past three years, 19 mothers living in an apartment building a block away from Franklin were also diagnosed with leukemia. Dunn then introduced a teacher at Franklin, Tammy Sanchez. Tammy said, \"In December 2002, we received some very disturbing news. One of my students was diagnosed with leukemia. Then, more children at Franklin were diagnosed with leukemia. I later found out that three kids at a nearby apartment building were diagnosed with leukemia. Sanchez then explained about more cancer-related deaths near Franklin, including 19 mothers all living in he same apartment building who were diagnosed with leukemia, which took over three minutes. \"To me, this is way too much,\" said Sanchez. Socorro Molina, whose son Diego, a student at Franklin, is undergoing treatment for his leukemia, had this to say: \"My son has leukemia. I'm worried, because there are many kids. Children who played with my son died from leukemia. They should do some investigations of these companies.\" Senator Dunn responded, \"Thank you, Socorro. I know it's difficult to share that privately, and you have shared this with us publicly on two occasions.\" Senator Dunn then said, \"at the end of that [previous] meeting, we were requested by a parent for a map of all businesses releasing toxic materials. We asked the AQMD for a map that showed every single business that releases harmful materials into our air. This is that map. The heaviest concentration of these businesses are, guess where? Near Franklin. This map is striking. The OCSD gave us a map showing all businesses that release toxic materials into our sewers. The largest concentration of these businesses are, guess where? Near Franklin and Kennedy Elementary Schools.\" Senator Dunn promised that at the next town hall meeting, he will have a panel of scientists present to determine if the substances released by these business pose a health risk to residents of the area. \"We are going to keep at this until we find out what is making our kids sick,\" he said. Santa Ana City Council member Jose Solorio said that \"the city has been following the media's attention. I got to tell you, this is a very complex issue. The city has jurisdiction over land use; they can issue restrictions. We, as elected officials, need to know more.\" Solorio then introduced the city's planning director and other city officials. Solorio added, \"the mayor of Santa Ana, Miguel Pulido, is a board-member for AQMD.\" Miguel Pulido has not attended any of the town hall meetings, and has not spoken about this issue at any time. Dunn then introduced the next panelist, Santa Ana Unified School District board member Rosemary Avila. She said, \"the school board is looking into this. I've talked to some teachers on the phone I believe the federal disease organization has been contacted about this.\" The Center for Disease Control was notified by parents of the leukemia cases in Santa Ana, but stated that they were \"within the acceptable range\". Avila then introduced some school board officials, and said, \"there has been some concern in the past, and we have looked into that. As a school district, we really have to act not out of fear, but with facts.\" Jill Whynot of the AQMD noted that \"there are 515 facilities in Santa Ana that we issue permits to\". Barry Wallerstein, Executive Officer of the AQMD said, \"we appreciate the forum. There appears to be a need for closer air quality monitoring. So, I propose that we make Santa Ana a high priority and closely monitor air quality in your community.\" That statement was met with much applause from the audience. Senator Dunn responded, \"we thank the AQMD for being here and answering our questions. We will be sure to let everybody know about any updates. When I looked at the map, I was struck. There are 515 permitted businesses in Santa Ana. We will bring some scientists in at the next town hall meeting to determine which businesses are releasing carcinogenic pollutants,\" he said. \"When I look at the maps, there are two pockets of permitted facilities in Santa Ana. Do you [AQMD] look at the cumulative impact of facilities grouped together [when considering issuing a permit]?\" Dunn posed. Dr. Wallerstein responded, \"the short answer is 'partially'\". Senator Dunn, responding to Dr. Wallerstein's comments, said \"if we need to give AQMD more power in terms of cumulative impact of permitted facilities, then we will introduce legislation to give them that power.\" The Senator then asked City Councilman Solorio, \"does the city in any way look at what type of business it is, or its cumulative impact [when approving a business]?\" Solorio responded, \"one of the main things the city does is make a General Plan, and unlike Irvine or Newport Beach, we are an older city.\" Solorio went on to talk about how in the future, the city could pass litigation limit permits, and said that \"we all need to do our part\". Referring to concerns about the steel plating plant next to a school, he said, \"Markland came into an industrial area, so they have a legal right to set up shop\". Dunn asked Solorio if the city is now looking at regulation to limit this, and Solorio responded, \"We always have opportunities to look at our General Plan, and we need to have solid facts to make those decisions\". Dunn asked Dr. Wallerstein, \"what about this pocket of businesses in south Santa Ana, is that unusual?\" Wallerstein responded, \"Senator, I don't think that's an issue\".", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "California", "latitude": 37.0, "longitude": -120.0}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "California", "latitude": 37.0, "longitude": -120.0}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Orange County", "latitude": 33.67, "longitude": -117.78}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}, {"name": "Newport Beach", "latitude": 33.61, "longitude": -117.89}, {"name": "Irvine", "latitude": 33.66, "longitude": -117.82}, {"name": "Santa Ana", "latitude": 33.74, "longitude": -117.88}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Scientists found traces of the HIV-1 genome collected in 1960 from a woman who lived in L\u00e9opoldville, presently called Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. An earlier study had also isolated the virus from a 1959 blood sample of a male from L\u00e9opoldville. Study of both the samples and estimate of the rate at which the virus mutates over time has led the researchers to conclude that the human strain could have been around for 100 years. The study, co-sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was carried out by Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona and colleagues from the United States, France, Belgium, Australia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Denmark. Earlier estimates of this nature had indicated the first infection in humans occurred between 1915 and 1941. The present study pushes the date of the infection back to sometime between 1884 and 1924, with a more focused estimate at 1908. Earlier studies have suggested that HIV-1 virus was spread from chimpanzees to humans in Cameroon. \"Now, for the first time, we have been able to compare two relatively ancient HIV strains. That helped us to calibrate how quickly the virus evolved and make some really robust inferences about when it crossed into humans, how the epidemic grew from that time, and what factors allowed the virus to enter and become a successful human pathogen,\" Dr. Worobey said. \"HIV is one of these pathogens that you could almost think of as living on the edge of extinction,\" Worobey continued. He believes that had HIV not been carried to a city, it may not have survived the jump to humans. \"It means there are things we could do to actually make it so that it doesn't have a chance of spreading,\" Worobey said. The first human infection could have happened around the time when the colonial cities were established in Africa. Rapid urbanization in colonial Africa around the beginning of the twentieth century may be responsible for the spread of the AIDS pandemic. It is estimated that several thousand people were infected by the 1960s. Today, HIV infection is reported in 33 million people and has killed 25 million. Researchers opine that an understanding of the origin and pathways for human infection of the virus could help in developing a vaccine to fight it.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Africa", "latitude": 7.18, "longitude": 21.09}, {"name": "L\u00e9opoldville", "latitude": -4.32, "longitude": 15.32}, {"name": "Kinshasa", "latitude": -4.32, "longitude": 15.32}, {"name": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "latitude": -2.88, "longitude": 23.65}, {"name": "L\u00e9opoldville", "latitude": -4.32, "longitude": 15.32}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Tucson", "latitude": 32.22, "longitude": -110.92}, {"name": "Arizona", "latitude": 34.0, "longitude": -112.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "France", "latitude": 47.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "Belgium", "latitude": 50.83, "longitude": 4.0}, {"name": "Australia", "latitude": -25.0, "longitude": 133.0}, {"name": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "latitude": -2.88, "longitude": 23.65}, {"name": "Denmark", "latitude": 56.0, "longitude": 10.0}, {"name": "Cameroon", "latitude": 6.0, "longitude": 12.0}, {"name": "Africa", "latitude": 7.18, "longitude": 21.09}, {"name": "Africa", "latitude": 7.18, "longitude": 21.09}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The day was marked by thousands of events around the world. \"It is now time for bold leadership at all levels in order to turn the tide of HIV,\" said Felicita Hikuam, Global Programmes Manager, World AIDS Campaign. An estimated 33.2 million people around the world\u2014one in every 200\u2014are living with HIV, and approximately 6,800 people are infected with HIV and 5,700 people die of AIDS-related illnesses every day. \"The trend is encouraging but still for every person receiving treatment four others are newly infected,\" said Nelson Mandela, speaking at a concert in Johannesburg, South Africa. \"If we are to stop the Aids epidemic from expanding, we need to break the cycle of new HIV infections. All of us working together with government, communities and civil society can make the difference that is needed,\" he continued. As many as 50,000 people attended the concert in Johannesburg, South Africa, which was telecast around the world. It was organized by Nelson Mandela's 46664 AIDS campaign and featured performances by artists such as Peter Gabriel, Ludacris, Razorlight, the Goo Goo Dolls and Annie Lennox. At a fundraiser in the town of Midrand, in the province Gauteng, near Johannesburg on Friday, singer Annie Lennox had strong words for the South African government's AIDS policies. \"AIDS, as Madiba [Mandela] has said, is a human rights issue and should be treated as such in order to avoid this genocide that is affecting millions and millions of people around the world,\" said Lennox in a speech. Lennox has previously been critical of the South African government's position on suggesting some AIDS medications were toxic. \"It is unacceptable that treatment has not been made available to those who need it most,\" said Lennox. The rock band Queen, which lost its lead singer Freddie Mercury to AIDS, released a new song entitled, Say It's Not True, to coincide with World Aids Day. It has been made available as a free download from the band's website. \"By making the song available for free, we hope to help Nelson Mandela with his campaign to get across the message that no-one is safe from infection,\" said Queen drummer Roger Taylor. \"We have to be aware, we have to protect ourselves and those we love.\" In China, people distributed AIDS prevention brochures in the streets and promoted safe sex in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. In Changsha, official warning signs were put on hotel bedstands. The government announced on Friday an allocation of CNY860 million for AIDS prevention and control. According to official reports, there are estimated to be 700,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in China. Also in China, the Miss World 2007 was in Sanya on World AIDS Day. The pageant presented a special tribute to the fight against AIDS, with a televised speech from former South African President Nelson Mandela, along with traditional dancers from South Africa who joined the contestants in a special song. Friday, United States President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to double the 2003 Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to US$30 billion over the next five years. \"Above all, we rededicate ourselves to a great purpose: We will turn the tide against HIV/AIDS\u2014once and for all,\" he said. \"I'm pleased to announce that Laura and I will travel to sub-Saharan Africa early next year,\" Bush said.

A majority of the cases were reported by the United States, which now has at least 10,053 confirmed infections from the disease. Egypt, Bulgaria, and Nicaragua each reported their first case, while Lebanon reported three. The WHO's pandemic alert level is at the fifth level, on a scale of one to six. In order for a transition for the highest level to be made, the organisation must confirm a significant spread of swine flu in at least two continents. The WHO has recently been under pressure to include the severity of a disease spread to its criteria, not just the geographical spread of a virus. The WHO said that its committee had agreed that a statement on the strength of an epidemic should be made in any future pandemic declarations. \"There was a broad consensus on the importance of including information on severity in future announcements,\" the WHO said in a statement. Australian health minister Nicola Roxon said that there are currently 878 confirmed cases of the influenza in Australia. The bulk of the cases have been in the state of Victoria, which has 752 infected persons. New South Wales is the second, with 74 infections. Roxon predicted that the swine flu will be a problem in the next two winters, despite efforts to curb its spread. \"I would have thought we're not at the halfway point, given that we still don't have an extensive spread in Australia,\" Roxon said. \"We are only part way, but closer, to having a vaccine and we are still prepared to put all our efforts into containing the disease as much as possible.\" Roxon said that Australia's hospitals will start taking samples from people infected with the flu to monitor its spread. She said that \"it gives us the tools to monitor how much of the flu in the coming weeks is seasonal flu, how much is actually this H1N1 strain, and we will simply have to keep monitoring that over the coming months.\" Roxon added that \"this is a time to be cautious, where the combination of the flus might turn it into something much less virulent or something more virulent.\" Meanwhile, Singapore has urged its residents not to travel to Victoria. A warning at the government website said that Melbourne and Victoria were affected by the disease, and advised any Singapore residents returning from those areas to keep an eye on their health for swine flu symptoms. The health ministry of Brazil announced on Tuesday that the number of infected people in the country has been increased to 23 after two new cases were confirmed. 25 people are also suspected to be infected. The ministry said that both new patients are in stable condition, and had both been infected after traveling to the U.S. Of Brazil's H1N1 cases, nine are in S\u00e3o Paulo, seven in Rio de Janeiro, four in Santa Catarina, and one apiece in Rio Grande do Sul, Tocantins, and Minas Gerais. Seven of the cases had been transmitted domestically. 1,795 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 were reported in three territories and nine provinces of Canada as of Wednesday. The federal health minister, Leona Aglukkaq, pledged on Friday to give CA$10.8 million to help fight the flu. The Canadian government is creating a new swine flu network to help connect health officials with researchers. \"These projects will have huge benefits [...] They will help public health officials across Canada in their efforts to plan, design and evaluate interventions to control the spread of the virus and protect the health of Canadians,\" Aglukkaq said. Almost four hundred swine flu cases in the South American country of Chile have been reported, local health officials say. The Institute of Public Health in Santiago reported that 393 cases were confirmed in the country in a statement on its website. The institute said that while 98% of cases were only \"mild\", about two percent of all infections were fatal. Swine flu cases in Chile have increased twofold within the last seven days. New Zealand now has eleven confirmed cases of the swine flu. A further 63 are in quarantine and have been prescribed the antiviral drug oseltamivir (which goes by the trade name of Tamiflu). Health officials from the Philippines said that seven more people tested positive for the influenza on Thursday, increasing the number of confirmed infections from the disease in the country to 29. There are a further 47 laboratory results pending confirmation. Francisco Duque, the Philippines' health secretary, said six of the cases were in Filipinos who had returned from visits to the U.S. \"With further characterization of the virus in our local cases, if we see that A/H1N1 poses no severe threat and is self-limited in most cases, we may be seeing a shift in our control strategy to outpatient and home management of patients showing only mild symptoms,\" Duque said. Russia has reported its first case of the flu, in an unidentified 28-year-old man who had recently been in New York. The man had initially passed a medical check when he arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport last Monday, but began to feel ill two days later and was hospitalised the same day. It is currently uncertain how he obtained the virus. Russian officials are currently screening flights that have departed from \"countries of concern\", including all countries in the Americas, as well as Japan and Spain. People arriving on flights from such countries have their temperatures checked by remote sensors, and those with high temperatures are hospitalised and tested for the H1N1 virus. Over a score of people so far have been identified as having symptoms of the disease, but all of them were cleared after later tests. Turkey's first case happened on May 16 when a passenger flying from United States to Iraq through a connected flight over Turkey entered to \u0130stanbul Atat\u00fcrk International Airport. With the latest arrival of 2 Turkish passengers from New York and Toronto on June 3, the number of confirmed cases increased to 10. The Turkish Ministry of Health reported that no infections related for human-to-human transfer of the virus are observed until now and the hospitalized cases are treated in a dedicated hospital in Istanbul. 486 people have been confirmed as infected with the H1N1 virus in the United Kingdom. 27 new cases in England were confirmed recently. Five people in the Glasgow area have been hospitalised. Three of them are in intensive care, although one man recently improved and was moved into to high dependency. A 44-year-old woman, who is said to have had underlying health conditions, is also in high dependency, at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, in Paisley. Scotland is the part of the UK with the highest ratio of affected people to population. The U.S. is the country with the highest number of confirmed swine flu infections. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that at least 27 people have died from the virus, and a further 13,271 cases have been reported throughout the country. All fifty states, as well as two territories, have reported cases. The state of Wisconsin has been the worst hit, with 2,217 infections, as well as three additional suspected cases. \"What is unusual today is not that there has been a death from influenza. Over 37,000 people die in the United States each year of seasonal influenza, and the rates of death and illness from this novel H1N1 strain does not appear to be radically different,\" said Seth Foldy, a Wisconsin health official. \"What is unusual this year is that influenza continues to be widely circulating in Wisconsin and many, many other states this late in the year.\" Vietnam's fourth swine flu infection was confirmed on Thursday, in a six-year-old girl in Vietnam's capital of Ho Chi Minh City, a local media report said.

A recent scientific paper has found the mysterious fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has begun to establish into eastward Panama, heading across the Panama Canal boundary towards Colombian amphibian populations. The publication predicts that at the current rate, the fungus will spread into Tort\u00ed (Panam\u00e1 Province) before 2012. The chytrid fungus is believed to be the leading cause of population mortality of amphibians. Species like the common rocket frog (Colostethus panamensis) are succumbing to the effects of the pathogen at an alarming rate. For the last 30 years, the infection has decimated amphibian communities, mostly because of increased temperatures resulting from climate change. The culprit skin fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is still not fully understood. It can be transmitted by touch, including contact with other amphibians and even rocks and water. Not only has it decimated frogs, salamanders and caecilians in the Americas, but has affected tropical Australia and Asia as well. Scientists think that the fungus may have come from an African clawed frog (Xenopus sp.), because of its worldwide popularity in the pet trade.

The swan is believed to have been native to Scotland. Two other swans found in Richmond Park in Glasgow are being tested for the H5N1 virus. They are among at least 14 other dead birds and 12 more swans found in Glasgow, that are being tested for the H5N1 virus. This is the United Kingdom's first confirmed case of the H5N1 virus and would make the U.K. the 14th country to report the virus. \"The risk to humans has not changed by the fact that we have found the virus in the UK. There is a better chance of a person winning the national lottery than catching bird flu in the U.K. today,\" said Doctor Jim Robertson from the National Institutes for Biological Standards and Control in a press conference. \"We also have to work on the assumption that there is some spread among wild birds. There is no doubt we are getting closer to the day when moving birds indoors will be necessary,\" said former President of the British Veterinary Association, Bob McCracken. \"The situation is that the virus is there, and it will probably continue to circulate among the birds. It will spread through close contact, irrespective of species. There is one big question mark: Will the virus disappear from wild birds after a period of six months, or will it still be present after a period of six years?\" added McCracken. McCracken also said that the virus could turn up in more birds saying, \"I would start from the assumption that a small pool of wild birds in the Fife area are infected and potentially passing it on to other birds\" and that seagulls could pose a threat of passing on the virus because they have been known to peck at the bodies of other dead birds that were infected. \"We have to assume that,\" he said. In a statement by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, released yesterday, the Scottish Executive confirmed that a \"highly pathogenic H5 avian flu\" virus was found in a sample taken from the dead swan. The swan was discovered March 29, 2006 and has been confirmed as a domestic species and officials say that it may have caught the virus from another infected bird. Officials also report that the area where the swan has been found is being sealed off. \"In accordance with a recent EU decision the Scottish Executive is putting in place a protection zone of a minimum of three kilometres radius and a surveillance zone of 10 kilometers. Keepers of birds in the protection zone are being instructed to isolate their birds from wild birds, by taking them indoors where ever possible,\" said the Scottish Executive in a statement. Samples from the swan were sent to the European Union Bird Flu Laboratory at Weybridge. \"Bird keepers outside the protection zone should redouble their efforts to prepare for bringing their birds indoors if that becomes necessary. They must also review their biosecurity measures to ensure that all possible precautions have been taken,\" said Charles Milne, Chief Veterinary Officer for Scotland yesterday in the statement. An exercise named 'Exercise Hawthorn' was to prepare people for a possible pandemic was taking place yesterday and was halted just after the discovery of the dead swan. Officials were in the second phase of the exercise. Taking part in the exercises were the Ministry of Defence, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Environment Agency and several other areas of the British government. \"I brought to an end the national avian influenza exercise to ensure that we can bring all our resources to bear on this situation. We are already in a high state of readiness and I have every confidence that officials north and south of the border will work together to manage this incident successfully,\" said the United Kingdom's Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby Reynolds. However; today Reynolds stated \"there is no reason for public health concern\" and also stated that in order for Bird Flu to infect humans, it would require \"extremely close contact with infected birds, particularly feces.\" According to the World Health Organization H5N1 has killed 109 people worldwide since 2003.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Cellardyke", "latitude": 56.21, "longitude": -2.7}, {"name": "Fife", "latitude": 56.25, "longitude": -3.2}, {"name": "Scotland", "latitude": 56.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "Scotland", "latitude": 56.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "Glasgow", "latitude": 55.85, "longitude": -4.25}, {"name": "Glasgow", "latitude": 55.85, "longitude": -4.25}, {"name": "United Kingdom", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "U.K.", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "UK", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "U.K.", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "Fife", "latitude": 56.25, "longitude": -3.2}, {"name": "Weybridge", "latitude": 51.36, "longitude": -0.45}, {"name": "Scotland", "latitude": 56.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "United Kingdom", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

According to the United Nations' World Health Organisation, there are a total of 331 confirmed cases of swine flu throughout the world, with hundreds more suspected cases. The WHO raised its pandemic alert level to its fifth level on Friday, on a scale of one to six, and has said that it is possible a transition to the highest level will be made. The Canadian government increased the number of swine flu incidents in their country to 51 on Friday, with seventeen new cases having been reported throughout the day. Canada now has the third highest number of swine flu cases reported by country, following Mexico and the United States. \"All of them [swine flu cases] are relatively mild,\" said Gordon Campbell, the premier of British Columbia. \"Unfortunately, we may see some deaths. It's important for us to recognize that.\" The breakdown of cases in Canada by province is as follows: fifteen in British Columbia, fourteen in Nova Scotia, twelve in Ontario, eight in Alberta, one in New Brunswick, and one in Quebec. Health authorities in Alberta said they have found the first human-to-animal transmission of the virus. Dr. Brain Evans said a Canadian who returned from Mexico on April 12 infected a pig farm that he worked at. Around two hundred pigs have been quarantined and are now waiting to recover. At this time, there is no evidence of humans getting the virus from infected pigs. Despite assurances from public health officials that the H1N1 virus is not transmitted to humans from animals, the Egyptian government has ordered all 400,000 pigs in the country to be slaughtered, a move that the UN has denounced as \"a real mistake\". Medical staff are to check passengers arriving at Cairo airport from Mexico, and monitor them during their stay in Egypt. No cases of swine flu have yet been reported in the country. German officials have said that a nurse living in Bavaria obtained the virus, apparently contracting it from a patient that had recently visited Mexico. The nurse has since recovered. Germany has had the second case of human-to-human transmission of the virus, other than Mexico, raising concerns of a possible pandemic. Spain was the first country to have reported a transmission of the flu from a person that had not visited Mexico. Hong Kong reported its first confirmed case of the swine flu on Friday in a 25-year-old man who had travelled from Mexico through Shanghai. The 300 residents of the hotel he was staying in have been placed under quarantine. Media reports say that police officers wearing masks are now guarding the exits of the building. Health officials say that the hotel will remain sealed off for a week, and the Tamilflu antiviral drug given to all residents and staff inside. The infected man is now reported to be in Hong Kong's Princess Margaret Hospital, where he is in stable condition. \"I assure you the Hong Kong government will try its best to conquer the virus. I stress we don't need to panic,\" said Donald Tsang, the Hong Kong Chief Executive. Chen Zhu, the Chinese health minister, said that it was probable the disease would soon spread to mainland China. Health officials from Mexico, the country where the virus is suspected to have originated, have confirmed fifteen deaths and 328 infections from the swine flu. On Friday, the government began a shutdown of the country for five days, in an effort to stop the disease from spreading. It has encouraged non-essential public facilities and government operations to close down. Several airlines and cruise lines have cancelled or suspended destinations in Mexico. Continental Airlines lowered the number of Mexican-bound flights by half, citing reduced demand for tickets. Carnival Cruise lines, meanwhile, has cancelled all its stops at the country's ports until May 11. Previously, the cruise line had suspended all of its visits until May 4. Jose Angel Cordova said that the number of new cases and hospitalisations from the disease seemed to be slowing down; only 46 persons with severe symptoms of the influenza were admitted on Thursday, less than a fourth of the 212 patients that had been admitted on April 20. Cordova called the figures \"encouraging\". Miguel Angel Lezana, the chief epidemiologist in the country, has accused the WHO of taking too much time to respond to Mexico's warning. Lezana said that his centre had informed a regional branch of the WHO of a sharp increase in sicknesses on April 16, but the WHO had not taken any action for eight days. The WHO rejected the accusations. \"There are cases of influenza all the time, but once we knew that this illness was caused by a new influenza virus [...] we moved into operation within a matter of hours,\" said Thomas Abrahams, a spokesman for the WHO. \"One of the things we are doing internally is documenting everything we have done, when we did it and how we have done it.\" In a televised address, Mexican president Felipe Calderon encouraged people to stay at home with their families, saying that there is \"no place as safe as your own home.\" 136 suspected cases of the influenza have been reported in New Zealand as of Friday, the government said. The number is a sharp increase over the 25 suspected cases on Thursday. There are currently three confirmed and thirteen probable cases of the flu, according to Health Minister Tony Ryall. Officials stated that a passenger that had arrived from North America on April 19 had tested positive for influenza A, similar to the swine flu virus. Julia Peters, the top medical official of Auckland, said that \"we are involved today in an extensive contact-tracing exercise with his place of work.\" The passenger had arrived on the 19th, but did not start displaying symptoms of the flu until April 22 and did not seek medical help until April 28, when he and his family were placed into a quarantine. John Odey, the Environment Minister of the African country of Nigeria, stated on Tuesday that the government has ordered all ships and aircraft arriving in Nigeria are to be checked and cleaned, in a move to prevent the entrance of the flu into the nation. The Nigerian government has advised ill persons wishing to travel out of the country to delay such trips, while those who have returned from abroad and have the symptoms of the flu are urged to immediately seek medical help. New cases of the swine flu have been reported on Friday in 30 US states, including Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The total number of cases in the country has reached 226, with one confirmed death in a 22-month-old boy in Houston, Texas. In an effort to curb the spread of the virus, approximately 400 schools have been shut down across the country, 300 of them in Texas and a further 62 in Alabama. All high school state track-and-field championships in the two states have been cancelled. In addition, Fort Worth's annual Mayfest, which attracts about 200,000 people over four days, has been called off. The US has said it will purchase thirteen million packages of antiviral treatment, and export 400,000 of those to Mexico. An aide to Steven Chu, the US Energy Secretary, has reportedly fallen ill from the virus after helping arrange President Barack Obama's trip to Mexico. However, the White House says that Obama is not at risk of obtaining the flu.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -95.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "British Columbia", "latitude": 54.0, "longitude": -125.0}, {"name": "Canada", "latitude": 60.0, "longitude": -95.0}, {"name": "British Columbia", "latitude": 54.0, "longitude": -125.0}, {"name": "Nova Scotia", "latitude": 45.0, "longitude": -63.0}, {"name": "Ontario", "latitude": 50.0, "longitude": -85.0}, {"name": "Alberta", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -115.0}, {"name": "New Brunswick", "latitude": 46.0, "longitude": -66.0}, {"name": "Quebec", "latitude": 53.0, "longitude": -70.0}, {"name": "Alberta", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -115.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Cairo", "latitude": 30.04, "longitude": 31.23}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Egypt", "latitude": 26.0, "longitude": 30.0}, {"name": "Bavaria", "latitude": 48.77, "longitude": 11.43}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Germany", "latitude": 51.0, "longitude": 9.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Spain", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -4.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Hong Kong", "latitude": 22.3, "longitude": 114.2}, {"name": "Shanghai", "latitude": 31.22, "longitude": 121.47}, {"name": "Hong Kong", "latitude": 22.3, "longitude": 114.2}, {"name": "Hong Kong", "latitude": 22.3, "longitude": 114.2}, {"name": "Hong Kong", "latitude": 22.3, "longitude": 114.2}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "North America", "latitude": 54.77, "longitude": -105.64}, {"name": "Auckland", "latitude": -36.84, "longitude": 174.74}, {"name": "Nigeria", "latitude": 8.0, "longitude": 10.0}, {"name": "Nigeria", "latitude": 8.0, "longitude": 10.0}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Delaware", "latitude": 39.0, "longitude": -75.5}, {"name": "Illinois", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -89.0}, {"name": "Kentucky", "latitude": 37.5, "longitude": -85.0}, {"name": "South Carolina", "latitude": 34.0, "longitude": -81.0}, {"name": "Tennessee", "latitude": 36.0, "longitude": -86.0}, {"name": "Houston", "latitude": 29.76, "longitude": -95.38}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Texas", "latitude": 31.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Alabama", "latitude": 32.7, "longitude": -86.7}, {"name": "Fort Worth", "latitude": 32.75, "longitude": -97.33}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

The UN reports it has left at least 1,600 people dead. The floods have been confirmed as the worst in eighty years. Heavy monsoon rains led to the flooding of the huge Indus River, destroying homes in the north of the country and causing a large amount of damage in the north-west frontier province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Manuel Bessler of the United Nations said: \"What we are facing now is a major catastrophe. We are afraid it will get worse.\u201d Army and government forces have rushed to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from parts of the Punjab province of Pakistan, where the disaster spread to yesterday, and from Sindh province, where the flood is expected to reach by the weekend. The flooding is now in its second week and the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, especially since in many parts of the country there is still torrential rain, with more forecast. In other parts of Pakistan the water has receded, but this leaves a layer of mud and slime and this covers very large areas. For those affected by the floods, disease is the biggest problem now. The insanitary conditions have already caused diarrhoea and respiratory infections. Cholera and other water-borne diseases may appear if sanitary conditions for those displaced by the calamity are not established. Medical supplies are desperately needed for doctors to keep a pandemic or epidemic of a water-borne disease from infecting the victims of the flooding. Many foreign governments and aid agencies are contributing to the disaster relief effort. The U.S. Army has been flying relief missions, airlifting people from areas where they are stranded. The first mission involved four U.S. Chinook helicopters landing in the tourist town of Kalam in the Swat Valley, north-west Pakistan. The resort had been cut off for more than a week, according to a reporter there. The Chinooks flew hundreds of people to safer areas lower down. A U.S. Embassy spokesperson said that 800 people had been evacuated and relief goods had been distributed. The U.S. government pledged 10 million dollars in assistance following the first reports of the disaster. Yesterday the country promised a further 25 million dollars in aid. A spokesperson from the Embassy said: \"The U.S. is making a new contribution of 25 million dollars in assistance to flood-affected populations, bringing its total commitment to date to more than 35 million dollars.\" The money will go to international aid organisations and established Pakistani aid groups to provide food, health care and shelter to people displaced by the floods. Malaysia has also decided to contribute US$1 million for relief efforts in the form of humanitarian aid. The Foreign Ministry said the aid was a manifestation of the government and the people's concern and sympathy. \"The government of Malaysia hopes the contribution will help alleviate the suffering of flood victims in Pakistan.\" In Britain, the Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella organisation representing 13 of the leading UK humanitarian agencies, has been coordinating relief efforts and has launched an emergency appeal for public donations to help the victims of the crisis.

Ebola haemorrhagic fever generates mortality rates in the range of 50 to 90 percent, typically. There is currently no vaccine or effective treatment for Ebola. WHO describes the symptoms of Ebola as being \"characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is often followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

MSF indicated that the transportation of supplies from the airport to the affected areas has been a challenge, due to poor road conditions. It has taken up to three days to travel the 250 km to the outbreak area from the provincial capital city, Kananga. MSF experts will provide advice on sanitary burial procedures, which would include the use of body bags and spraying. Both the WHO and MSF will disseminate information to the local population regarding the transmission of the virus and measures that could be taken to reduce the spread of the disease. The MSF emergency team coordinator in Kampungu, Rosa Crestani, described the isolation ward set up at Kampungu's health centre. \"Our isolation centre is basically divided in three parts. One is completely isolated, where the sick patients are; another is where the staff dresses with the complete protection uniform and then undresses after having been in contact with the patients; and the third part is a space for disinfection in between,\" said Crestani. \"In the coming days, we will decide with the Ministry of Health and the WHO whether we set up isolation structures in other locations of the health zone.\" Neighbouring countries, such as Rwanda and Zambia have issued alerts to their citizens, warning of travel to and from DRC. Zambian Health Minister Brian Chituwo stated that all people coming into Zambia from DRC will be watched for symptoms of Ebola for up to eight hours. Chituwo noted, however that it would be unlikely for an infected person to travel into the country, as the time between onset and death is very rapid and that the symptoms are severe. There has been a minimum of 395 people affected by haemorrhagic fever, including 160 deaths, in DRC in the past few months.

Queensland Premier Peter Beattie has declared a state of emergency in Innisfail and says he is worried about the outbreak of diseases. Army engineers are among more than 1,000 people assisting in Queensland's cyclone relief effort. Premier Beattie says it could be more than a week before power is restored in Innisfail. \"The whole bloody place is blown apart... this is going to be a long, slow recovery,\" he said. Larry caused widespread damage as it crossed the coast south of Cairns, with winds of up to 290km/h (180 mph). Thousands of buildings were damaged and most of the Australia's banana crop has been destroyed. Thousands of kilometres of power lines were brought down. Many key roads are flooded. State Emergency Service volunteers are putting tarpaulins on damaged homes. \"Some homes will need complete rebuilding and that will take many months. But right now let's get the bandaids out and get people settled as much as we can and then start the serious rebuilding of the Innisfail area.\" said Kathryn Ryan, from the Disaster Management Group Hospitals are unable to cope with the lack of clean running water and reliable power supplies. There are concerns about outbreaks of dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases. \"Our main concern is with the quality of the drinking water, the quality of people's food supplies and any health risks from inundation by water,\" a health spokesman said. Queensland Health Minister Jim Guthrie says there is no electricity in Innisfail, the hardest hit town in Cyclone Larry's path. \"It's just too difficult to keep the hospital operating,\" he said. \"There's no mains power but they're also having trouble with generators - there's a lack of fuel.\" The region's banana, sugar cane and avocado farm industries will need rebuilding. Jan Davis, of fruit growers' group Growcom, says Cyclone Larry will have widespread effects on the fruit industry. Among supplies flowing in were nearly 10,500 gallons of water and 6,000 in-flight meals provided by Qantas. Troops also set up a water purification unit, and health authorities warned residents to boil their water. \"There most certainly would be around 7,000 people \u2026 that are effectively homeless,\" Federal Minister Bob Katter told The Associated Press. \"They're sitting in four walls but no roof.\" Some 17,000 homes were blacked out in Cairns. Ergon Energy Regional services manager Geoff Bowes says generators have been sent to Innisfail to provide power for sewerage works and some supermarkets and extra staff have been flown in from Brisbane and Townsville. \"Nothing could prepare us for this,\" he said. The Australian reports that building industry and government sources have estimated the cost of Larry as \"one of Australia's most costly natural disasters, with a damage bill expected to exceed $1.5 billion.\" So far there have been no deaths or major injuries reported. Forecasters have warned of more wild weather for Queensland, with a second cyclone expected to approach the coast later this week.

There have been at least 3,330 deaths from the swine flu since the virus started spreading, out of almost 316,000 total reported cases. Nine countries \u2014 Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the UK, and the US \u2014 have promised to send ten percent of their antiviral vaccine supply to other countries, should the latter be in need of it. The plan was agreed to \"in recognition that diseases know no borders and that the health of the American people is inseparable from the health of people around the world,\" a statement by the US government read. In an in-depth report, Wikinews takes a look at how the disease has affected countries around the world. As of Wednesday, Brazil has registered 899 deaths from the swine flu, making it the hardest-hit country in terms of fatalities. The city of Sao Paulo reported 327 deaths, and Rio de Janeiro 84. However, the country's health ministry also said that the rate of serious cases \"fell for the fifth straight week.\" Brazil had surpassed the United States, which has 593 deaths, in number of total fatalities from the outbreak late in August. Argentina, Brazil's neighbour to the south, has 512 deaths from the H1N1 virus. 10,000 cases of swine flu were confirmed across China since the outbreak began. The number of infections seems to be increasing quickly. Communications director for the World Health Organisation Vivian Tan said that \"in the last week or so, the increase has been quite quick,\" attributing the rise to a small decrease in temperatures as fall sets in, as well as students returning to school after summer breaks. China's official news agency Xinhua reported that 1,118 new cases of the influenza were reported in a two-day period earlier in the week, adding that a vast majority of the cases had been transmitted in China, not by persons entering the country from abroad. All 31 of China's provinces have reported instances of the flu. The disease initially seemed to be limited to large cities, but recently has started moving into more rural areas. No casualties from the swine flu have yet been confirmed in China. The office of France's president Nicolas Sarkozy said that the country would pledge up to one tenth or nine million of its 94 million antiviral vaccine doses to the World Health Organisation, to be distributed to countries with fewer vaccine supplies if needed. International solidarity \"will be a determining factor in reducing the health, economic and social impact of the pandemic,\" according to a statement released by the government. On Wednesday, eleven people had been reported dead from the virus in India, taking the country's death toll up to 212 people. The number of people infected with the influenza is now estimated at 6,800. India's health ministry on Tuesday said that the Tamiflu drug would be on sale in the open market within seven days, allowing for a \"restricted sale\" of the drug. An unnamed official said that \"it is expected that within the next five to seven days, both the drugs would be available in the retail market through identified chemists against proper medical prescriptions. \"Taking into account the current spread of the influenza A(H1N1) in the country, the health ministry has decided that retail sale of Tamiflu and Zanamivir should be allowed in the country but in a regulated manner,\" he said. Previously, distribution of Tamiflu was prohibited by the government, and access to it was only available through public health institutions. At least 70 people in Kenya have the swine flu, according to local health official. In the latest outbreak, twenty high school students came down with the virus and had to be quarantined on Thursday. \"A majority of the affected students who are in Forms One and Two were treated and advised to remain under bed rest to minimise further spread of the disease among the student community,\" said the director of Public Health, Dr. Shanaaz Shariff. However, he said that the students' illness was \"not too serious to warrant hospitalisation.\" Security guards were placed around the school the students were isolated in, with orders only to allow medical personnel to enter the premises. Kenya's capital Nairobi has been the worst hit by the flu, having reported forty cases. Other cities affected by the flu are Kisumu and Rift Valley, who have reported eighteen and ten cases of the H1N1 virus, respectively. Mexico, the country in which the outbreak initially started, has 25,214 reported cases and 217 fatalities from the virus. Some recent cases have forced schools to close down. Jose Angel Cordova, the Mexican health secretary, said that the virus could infect as many as five million of Mexico's 107 million people, and, in a worst-case scenario, cause up to 2,000 deaths. His estimate is higher than his previous prediction of 1 million cases and 1,000 deaths, made last month. About five thousand new cases of swine flu were reported in the United Kingdom in recent weeks, reversing a declining trend in the number of new infections. Health officials have suggested this could lead up to a second outbreak of the virus. \"We don't know whether this is the start of the next big wave that we were expecting this autumn but it is certainly something that's giving us concern. It will probably be a week or two before we see whether this increase is sustained.\" said Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer. Health authorities have said that at least 25 cases appear to have been resistant to the Tamiflu drug prescribed to treat the illness. Donaldson said that \"the positive side of it is that so far these have not been strains that have then gone on and affected other patients, they have stayed with the patient in which they were isolated. What would worry us is if we got a resistant strain that then started infecting people like the rest of the cases of flu that have occurred.\" The UK is one of several countries that have pledged up to one tenth of their vaccine stock to to other countries if they are in need of more supplies. \"Britain recognizes that H1N1 is a global pandemic which requires a global response,\" the International Development Secretary, Douglas Alexander, said. \"Solidarity with other nations is vital, particularly the poorest who may be most vulnerable and have least capacity to respond.\" The US government recently bought 195 million doses of swine flu vaccine. Health Care Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that free shots will be given out early in October. The vaccination is to be voluntary, but priority will be given to certain groups, such as toddlers and children, adults over the age of 65, and pregnant women, who are considered especially vulnerable to the virus. \"We remain confident that the United States will have sufficient doses of the vaccine to ensure that every American who wants a vaccine is able to receive one,\" a White House statement said. As of September 16, the US had 593 deaths from the flu. 144 people in Vietnam were diagnosed with the swine flu on Wednesday, bringing the total number of infected people in the country to 5,648. This week, the number of affected people has increased by 1104 infections or 6.3%. Nguyen Tran Hien, the director of the Central Institute of Hygiene Epidemiology, predicted that the swine flu would peak at the end of 2009 and the beginning 2010. The Vietnamese Ministry of Health called for more research into a swine flu vaccine, and urged the the National Steering Board on Flu Prevention in Humans to give out more doses of the drug Tamiflu to areas hardest hit by the flu.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Australia", "latitude": -25.0, "longitude": 133.0}, {"name": "Brazil", "latitude": -10.0, "longitude": -52.0}, {"name": "France", "latitude": 47.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "Italy", "latitude": 43.0, "longitude": 12.0}, {"name": "New Zealand", "latitude": -42.0, "longitude": 174.0}, {"name": "Norway", "latitude": 61.0, "longitude": 8.0}, {"name": "Switzerland", "latitude": 46.83, "longitude": 8.33}, {"name": "UK", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Brazil", "latitude": -10.0, "longitude": -52.0}, {"name": "Sao Paulo", "latitude": -23.55, "longitude": -46.63}, {"name": "Rio de Janeiro", "latitude": -22.9, "longitude": -43.19}, {"name": "Brazil", "latitude": -10.0, "longitude": -52.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Argentina", "latitude": -34.0, "longitude": -64.0}, {"name": "Brazil", "latitude": -10.0, "longitude": -52.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "France", "latitude": 47.0, "longitude": 2.0}, {"name": "India", "latitude": 21.0, "longitude": 78.0}, {"name": "India", "latitude": 21.0, "longitude": 78.0}, {"name": "Kenya", "latitude": 1.0, "longitude": 38.0}, {"name": "Kenya", "latitude": 1.0, "longitude": 38.0}, {"name": "Nairobi", "latitude": -1.28, "longitude": 36.81}, {"name": "Kisumu", "latitude": -0.1, "longitude": 34.75}, {"name": "Rift Valley", "latitude": 0.5, "longitude": 36.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "Mexico", "latitude": 23.0, "longitude": -102.0}, {"name": "United Kingdom", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "UK", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "Britain", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "US", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Vietnam", "latitude": 16.16, "longitude": 107.83}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

In the study of 124 children aged eight to eighteen, kids who had antibodies to adenovirus 36 (AD36) weighed on average 50 pounds more than children who didn't have the antibodies. When children have AD36 antibodies, that means they had the virus at some point in their life. AD36 causes colds and eye infections. Comparing the obese children who had the antibodies versus the obese children who didn't have the antibodies, the kids with the antibodies were significantly more obese, at 35 pounds heavier. \u201cThis shows that body weight regulation and the development of obesity are very complicated issues,\" Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, the study's lead author, said. Schwimmer also said that \"[i]t's not simply a case that some children eat too much and others don't. There are children who eat all the wrong things in all the wrong quantities who are not obese.\" Schwimmer said that he's not blaming the US childhood obesity epidemic on the virus, but noted that \"I\u2019ve seen children who had very brisk weight gain in a given year for reasons that were very hard to pinpoint. These may be the children who have obesity related to this infection.\" The study is backed up by past reports that show the virus boosts production of fat cells. In studies in which animals were infected with AD36, the animals gained a significant amount of weight. There is currently no vaccine for AD36, and no routine screening for the virus. Dr. Goutham Rao, clinical director of the Weight Management and Wellness Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said that \"People want a magic solution. Unfortunately, we don't have one. What people can do is focus on a child's behaviors and eliminate the unhealthy behaviors.\" Rao also said that \"Instead of coming to the doctor and requesting a test for the virus, parents would do better to discuss key behaviors to combat obesity.\" Dr. James Cherry, specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), was also interested by the study. He said that if the link between AD36 and obesity were confirmed, developing a vaccine for the virus could be worthwhile. \"More than 20 percent of the obese children in this study were positive for the antibody.

She immediately spat it out, warned other patrons to stop eating, and upon recognizing the object as a finger, vomited. \"I'm more of a Carl's Jr. person,\" the 39-year-old Las Vegas woman, Anna Ayala, told Knight Ridder. She said this incident was her first visit to a Wendy's restaurant. Ayala described how she found the finger, \"Suddenly something crunchy was in my mouth,\" she continued, \"and I spit it out.\" According to Devina Cordero, 20, after Ayala found the finger, she ran up to her and Cordero's boyfriend and said, \"Don't eat it! Look, there's a human finger in our chili.\" \"We went up to the counter and they told us it was a vegetable,\" Cordero continued. \"The people from Wendy's were poking it with a spoon.\" The restaurant is located at 1405 Monterey Highway , just south of downtown San Jose. Wikinews reporter David Vasquez drove his car up to the drive-thru menu and found that chili was still on the menu, at a price of US$1.19 for a small serving. He also witnessed workers unloading supplies from a semi-trailer truck in the restaurant's parking lot, and carting them into the back door of the establishment. According to Ben Gale, director of environmental health for Santa Clara County, the finger did not come from any of the employees at the restaurant. \"We asked everybody to show us they have 10 fingers and everything is OK there,\" he said. The found portion of the finger likely belonged to a woman because of its long and manicured fingernail, also found in the food. Officials seized the food supply at the restaurant and are tracing it back to the manufacturer, where they believe the finger may have gotten mixed in with the raw ingredients used to prepare the chili. The restaurant's operators were later permitted to re-open after preparing new chili prepared from fresh ingredients. As this story was filed, there was no mention of the incident on the Wendy's corporate web site. Wendy's issued a statement through a spokesman. \"Food safety is of utmost importance to us,\" said Wendy's spokesman Joe Desmond. He referred to the incident as an \"unsubstantiated claim.\" \"We are cooperating fully with the local police and health departments with their investigation. It's important not to jump to conclusions. Here at Wendy's we plan to do right by our customers,\" Desmond said. According to county health officials, the unfortunate woman who bit into the finger is doing fine, despite her initial reaction. Officials also noted that the finger would have been cooked at a high enough temperature to destroy any viruses.

Autopsies by toxicologists from the WA Department of Agriculture will test for organochlorins, organophosphates and heavy metals. Esperance residents first noticed large numbers of dead birds littering their streets and gardens on December 7 last year. Populations of honeyeaters, wattle birds and miners have reportedly been effected. The birds were being found vomiting and convulsing in bushland and suburban backyards over an extensive area. Department of Environment and Conservation's (DEC) nature conservation coordinator Mike Fitzgerald says toxic wetlands near Esperance are the most likely reason for the mass bird deaths. The DEC says it has failed to figure out the cause of death despite interviewing industry groups, farmers, grain handlers and timber companies about pesticide and chemical use. Birds Australia, the peak group dedicated to the conservation, study and enjoyment of Australia's native birds and their habitats, said it had not heard of a similar occurrence. \"Not on that scale, and all at the same time, and also the fact that it's several different species,\" chief executive Graeme Hamilton told the Sunday Times. \"You'd have to call that a most unusual event and one that we'd all have to be concerned about.\" Mike Fitzgerald said the DEC were looking at something \"pretty potent.\" \"This is not a normal situation. The common thing that we have seen and heard is that the affected birds have an insatiable thirst... If it turns out to be a toxin that is responsible, that will raise more questions because there is no obvious source of exposure.\" The deaths could be a result of a drier than normal winter, causing algal and bacterial blooms in the Esperance Lakes Nature Reserves. Esperance recorded 457mm rainfall in 2006; the average is 620mm. Initially, health authorities feared a virus, such as the deadly avian bird flu, was responsible. That was quickly ruled out, along with poisoning from bacteria or eating poisoned insects. The first deaths were reported by Esperance resident Michelle Crisp - who lives close to the worst-affected area. Dozens of native birds began dying in her back yard a week before Christmas. She says she contacted neighbours to discover if they were experiencing the same thing. Mrs Crisp found four dead birds, then 16, then 30 and finally up to 80.

She was allegedly caught at Bali airport importing marijuana from Australia in October. Appearing before an Indonesian judge after authorities found 4.1kg of high-grade cannabis in her unlocked boarding bag, she could be sentenced to death by firing squad, the maximum penalty for the crime. With that possibility looming for Ms. Corby, her father journeyed to her side, and an anonymous email petition was distributed around Australia and overseas, calling on the Australian government to ensure that, innocent or guilty, Ms. Corby is returned to Australia to escape execution. An Australian witness who volunteered information which he says will endanger his own life, has testified that Schapelle Corby was unwittingly caught up in a domestic Australian drug-running operation gone wrong. The man alleged that Australian airport workers had placed the contraband in her luggage after it had been checked-in, with the drugs to have been removed before the luggage left Australia. Ms. Corby, who says she is innocent of the charges, staggered and paused to vomit while being led through a throng of journalists watching her trial in Jakarta, Indonesia, earlier today. \"I'm really sick,\" Ms. Corby told Densbar's head judge Linton Sirait, who told her to take better care of herself in jail so she would not get diarrhea. \"Don't be stressed,\" Judge Sirait added as he adjourned the trial until April 14. Her sister said a doctor would visit her in prison to assess her condition. Her father, suffering with prostate cancer, said it was difficult to watch his daughter struggling so hard when things were nearing the \"nitty-gritty now.\" He added: \"The stress and the whole thing and the stomach cramps and the nerves. It's getting on top of her.\" Australian politicians, noting the public support thrown behind the Gold Coast citizen, are promising to take her case up on several issues with the Indonesian Attorney-General later today. However, Mr. Corby expressed doubts that politicians could work things out: \"It depends on what they call justice here [in Indonesia]. It looks a bit fairyland to me.\" \"Everything's reversed here. You're guilty until you're proven innocent,\" commented Mr. Corby in Indonesia.

It reported that close to 30,000 people are living in and around three overcrowded reception centres near the Congolese border. The UNHCR said that a \"significant number\" of Angolan refugees that had been \"forcibly returned\" to their country were among those in the reception centres. \"You have the compounding factors of not having latrines and people drinking possibly contaminated water and with the rain coming, this is a recipe for disaster,\" said a UNHCR protection officer, Yolande Ditewig. She told the Agence France-Presse news agency that \"there is a lack of everything you can imagine, especially food and many people say they've not eaten for days.\" UN refugee agency spokesman Andrej Mahecic said that initial assessments found that people at those centres are in critical need of shelter, food, medicine and sanitation facilities. The supply of clean water is insufficient, according to Mahecic, and some of the Angolans were drinking from nearby contaminated rivers. As a consequence, many of the expelled families are reporting cases of diarrhea and vomiting. \"There are significant numbers of Angolan refugees among the forcibly returned. And, this is for us the most worrying aspect of this situation. Some of them say they had been rounded up and taken to the border despite the fact they carried documents certifying their refugee status. Others said they were forced back without having had a chance to take their identification documents or any of their belongings. Most of them were deported from the Bas Congo Province in southern DRC,\" Mahecic said. He added that these forced returns are in response to the expulsion of large numbers of Congolese from Angola since December 2008. He says an official agreement between the DRC and Angola may finally end these tit-for-tat expulsions. This, however, does not mean that the exodus will end in the near term. According to Mahetic, Angolan authorities expect further large scale returns of their nationals who no longer feel welcome in the DRC.

Last week, RC2, a U.S. toy company based in Oak Brook, Illinois, issued a recall for its popular wooden \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\" train sets. The recall involved 1.5 million \"Thomas Wooden Railway\" vehicles and train sets sold at toy stores and various retailers across the U.S. from January 2005 through June 2007. A subsequent recall has been issued in the United Kingdom, where Thomas the Tank Engine was originated in the 1940s as a character in a children's story by the Reverend W.V. Awdry. Around 70,000 toys are involved in the UK recall, according to The Guardian. \"RC2 has determined that the surface paints on the recalled products contain lead. Lead is toxic if ingested by young children and can cause adverse health effects,\" the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a press release dated June 13. \"Consumers should take the recalled toys away from young children immediately and contact RC2 Corp. for a replacement toy,\" the commission said. Those \"adverse health effects\" could include brain and nerve damage, especially in young children, as well as blood and brain disorders. Severe lead poisoning causes vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, anemia, loss of appetite, headaches and in particularly high doses, coma and death. In an article on Monday, The New York Times reported that recalls have been issued for 24 different toys in the U.S. in the past year, and every one of them was made in China. According to the Toy Industry Association, toys made in China account for around 70 percent to 80 percent of all the toys sold in the U.S., The Times said. \"These are items that children are supposed to be playing with,\" Prescott Carlson was quoted as saying by The Times. Carlson is a co-founder of a child-safety website called Imperfect Parent, which tracks recalls of toys and other baby products. \"It should be at a point where companies in the United States that are importing these items are held liable,\" Carlson said. RC2 would not comment to The Times, and a Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman would not say how long ago the problem with the lead paint was discovered. For a follow-up article on Tuesday, The Times visited a factory in Dongguan, in China's Guangdong province, where the \"Thomas and Friends\" toys are made. The paper interviewed workers and took photos on the factory floor. \"You're intruding,\" a factory manager identified only as Zhong was quoted as telling the reporters. \"Tell me, why exactly are you here?\" During the visit, a reporter, translator and a photographer were detained by factory officials, and released a day later after local police and government officials intervened. The factory also produces other toys for RC2, including toy John Deere trucks, NASCAR racing models and MandM's cars, The Times said. RC2 makes the toys under licenses from various companies. The \"Thomas and Friends\" toys are made under license from Hit Entertainment, which owns the \"Thomas\" brand.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Oak Brook", "latitude": 41.84, "longitude": -87.95}, {"name": "Illinois", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -89.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "United Kingdom", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "UK", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Dongguan", "latitude": 23.03, "longitude": 113.71}, {"name": "China", "latitude": 35.0, "longitude": 103.0}, {"name": "Guangdong", "latitude": 23.4, "longitude": 113.5}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

It emitted a sweet but noxious odor. It has now been blamed for a mass illness affecting roughly 200 villagers with \"nausea, vomiting, digestive problems and general sickness,\" according to a local health department official, Jorge L\u00f3pez. \"Boiling water started coming out of the crater and particles of rock and cinders were found nearby. Residents are very concerned,\" said L\u00f3pez. Police officers who went to investigate the meteorite are among those who have fallen ill and been taken to Desaguadero hospital. The impact of the meteorite left a crater 18 feet deep and 30 yards across in the Andean territory that is home to less than 1,000 people. Originally, the villagers thought a plane had crashed. Under consideration is the declaration of a state of emergency. Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute engineer Renan Ramirez said scientists who went to investigate the crater found no indication of radiation, although, the fumes from the crater were so pungent that one scientist said his throat and nose were irritated despite his use of a mask. Villagers are said to be avoiding the local water out of fear of contamination. Sulfur, arsenic and other elements common in meteorites can react with ground water to produce fumes. Ursula Marvin, a meteor expert at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Massachusetts, said a meteorite \"wouldn't get much gas out of the earth\" and that a more likely explanation for the health problems was the dust cloud caused when the rock hit the Earth. Other explanations abound. Don Yeomans, head of the Near Earth Object Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said \"Statistically, it's far more likely to have come from below than from above,\" noting that meteorites do not give off smells and it is likely the result of hydrothermal activity, such as a local gas explosion. Dr Caroline Smith, a meteorite expert with the Natural History Museum in London, thought more likely the villagers saw a common fireball and in the process of investigating it, did not find a 'crater' but \"a lake of sedimentary deposit, which may be full of smelly, methane rich organic matter.\" And one science blogger, David Syzdek, theorized that in fact the crater is a mud volcano \"that is producing toxic gasses [sic] such as methane, water, and perhaps other hydrocarbons. Many hydrocarbons can cause illness.\"", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Lake Titicaca", "latitude": -15.75, "longitude": -69.41}, {"name": "Puno", "latitude": -15.07, "longitude": -70.12}, {"name": "Peru", "latitude": -10.0, "longitude": -76.0}, {"name": "Bolivia", "latitude": -16.71, "longitude": -64.66}, {"name": "Desaguadero", "latitude": -16.56, "longitude": -69.03}, {"name": "Massachusetts", "latitude": 42.3, "longitude": -71.8}, {"name": "London", "latitude": 51.5, "longitude": -0.12}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Sizzler Australia Managing Director Bo Ryan said customer safety was always the restaurant chain\u2019s first priority. A media release on the Sizzler website states: \"As a precautionary measure and because customer health and safety is our number one priority, we have temporarily closed salad bars in all Sizzler Restaurants. We sincerely apologise for this major inconvenience.\" Police said green pellets were found in pasta sauce at a Sizzler restaurant in Brisbane's inner-west on January 20. A regular customer at the Toowong restaurant told Sizzler staff she had found something odd in her bolognese pasta sauce. Similar pellets were found in a vegetable soup at Sizzler's Myer Centre outlet in the city about 5pm on Saturday. Bo Ryan said the decision to close all of its Australian salad bars was made after laboratory tests confirmed that the substance in the pasta sauce was indeed rat poison. He said trainees who tasted the poisoned soup had been been taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution, but had suffered no ill effects. Queensland Police Inspector Bob Hytch said no one had been reported ill as a result of eating the poisoned food and there had been no extortion threats. Sarah Kenny, a university student, said she and two friends had eaten spaghetti bolognese that \"tasted really weird\". \"The inconvenience to customers and the economic impact on the company and its 1600 employees will be severe, but as a family restaurant our first priority is the welfare of our diners,\" said Bo Ryan. \"Steak and seafood and a limited range of salads would continue to be available.\" He hopes that customers will understand the action was taken in their best interests, and that \"they can be patient while temporary product security procedures are developed and implemented in all restaurants.\" The 29 Australian Sizzler Restaurants, along with 107 Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets are operated by the Collins Foods Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Worldwide Restaurant Concepts Inc.

He had alleged many associations between people in high places and organised international crime, implying that President Putin and Romano Prodi among others had been involved personally. He had sought political asylum in UK in 2000 and became a naturalised citizen in October this year, just weeks before his death. Mr Litvinenko was said to have been investigating the shooting of Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya, a well-known critic of Russian activities in Chechnya, in her apartment in Moscow October 7, 2006. It is reported that he had met two Russians in an hotel room, one said to be former member of the KGB in connection with the affair and he went on to meet Mario Scaramella at a sushi bar in Piccadilly where some papers were exchanged. Some hours after this he was taken ill. Mr Litvinenko was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, north London on November 1, 2006 complaining of feeling sick. By November 11, he was said to be suffering from serious poisoning. A week later he was transferred to University College Hospital in central London. A week later he was said to have been poisoned by ingesting thallium, once used in rat poison, but, in the opinion of some doctors, there were signs of radioactive poisoning, including loss of weight and shedding of hair. Various explanations of his condition were offered. Last night he suffered a heart attack, after having left a message blaming President Putin for having him killed. The radioactive isotope polonium-210 was found in his blood and urine as reported by the United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency. The post-mortem was cancelled. Subsequently the Agency examined conditions in the hospitals in which Mr Litvinenko has been treated. Police visited the Itsu sushi restaurant in Piccadilly, his home in Muswell Hill and the Millennium Hotel, Grosvenor Square where the meeting on November 1 had been held. Traces of radiocactivity were found in all three places. It is speculated that the polonium was probably eaten by Litvinenko as a substance that could be combined with a salt-like substance, such as polonium nitrate. It was reported that a meeting had been held in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) used for high level emergency planning and control, to consider the implications of these events. The Foreign Office asked Moscow for a response to the accusation of Russian involvement and President Putin himself dismissed the allegations saying (before the cause of death had been established) that there was no proof of an unnatural death and that the case was being used as a \"political provocation\".", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "Britain", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "UK", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "Chechnya", "latitude": 43.4, "longitude": 45.71}, {"name": "Moscow", "latitude": 55.75, "longitude": 37.61}, {"name": "Piccadilly", "latitude": 51.5, "longitude": -0.14}, {"name": "London", "latitude": 51.5, "longitude": -0.12}, {"name": "London", "latitude": 51.5, "longitude": -0.12}, {"name": "United Kingdom", "latitude": 55.0, "longitude": -3.0}, {"name": "Piccadilly", "latitude": 51.5, "longitude": -0.14}, {"name": "Muswell Hill", "latitude": 51.59, "longitude": -0.14}, {"name": "Grosvenor Square", "latitude": 51.51, "longitude": -0.15}, {"name": "Moscow", "latitude": 55.75, "longitude": 37.61}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

In an effort to clean up the dairy industry, the government shut down nearly 1,200 dairy farms last week. According to China Daily, local police detained a suspect in his 40s who is believed to have produced and supplied the tainted milk.

According to a Friday press release from the city government and local health bureau, the 35 people who fell ill by consuming the milk are being treated in two hospitals in Pingliang.

Inspector David Eldridge said Devon and Cornwall police were alerted to the caravan park incident after \"a helper had been unable to get a reply from an elderly couple who lived in the caravan\". He said that upon their arrival, \"We were able to see that there was a figure sat in a chair but they were unresponsive to knocks at the door.\" CFRS workers called to the area \"forced entry into the property and found that the three occupants were all dead\", Inspector Eldridge said. A hazardous material advisor was also present at the scene in Roskear. The Health and Safety Executive is now investigating the incident but the deaths are not considered as being of a suspicious nature. The three fatalities have been identified as Audrey Cook, aged 86, her husband Alfred, aged 90, and Maureen, their 46-year-old daughter. David Biggs, a member of Camborne Town Council, said the incident came as \"a shock\" to him; Tremarle Home Park is \"a well established facility and is very well run\", according to him. Biggs described the loss of three lives as an \"appalling tragedy\". The incident came five days after Cornwall Council announced its Family Placement Service would launch a joint venture with Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service to place carbon monoxide detectors in the houses of foster carers. The programme, entitled 'Be Gas Safe', has seen 200 carbon monoxide detectors and 2000 leaflets to raise awareness about carbon monoxide being given to CFRS. Mark Blatchford, Group Manager of CFRS, said: \"We have seen a big increase in the number of carbon monoxide incidents in Cornwall over recent years\". He described carbon monoxide detectors as being \"as important as a smoke alarm as it provides a valuable early warning\". Carbon monoxide is a poisonous, colourless, tasteless and odourless gas which is created when such carbon-based fuels as oil, gas, coal and wood are not completely incinerated. The human body's capacity to hold oxygen in the blood can be reduced by inhalation of the gas, which in turn may cause death.

A truck from Newmont Mining Company dumped two metal canisters of mercury along an Andean highway, in the communities of San Juan, Choropampa, and Magdalena. Curious townspeople (mostly children) picked up the silvery droplets, and some even drank some of it. Many residents became sick from severe mercury poisoning. Some of those who came in contact with the mercury suffered blindness, and one even had a purplish rash on her body. Over 300 people directly suffered the effects of mercury poisoning.

In today's global economy, many international businesses have looked overseas to maintain their profits, but environmental law professor James Otto is asking about the cost to the environment and public health. \"Any company that wants to mine internationally now must not only have the legal right to mine but also a 'social license' to operate,\" he said. \"Peru has been a wake-up call.\" As the Peruvian residents gear up for their lawsuit against Denver-based Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold mining firm, some of these important questions may finally be answered. After the breakdown of mediation talks with Newmont on January 20, the residents and their lawyer decided to stop negotiating behind closed doors and take their case to the public. Last Saturday, March 5, 2005, they announced that they are bringing their suit before Denver District Judge Robert Hyatt. \"If successful,\" states Ken Krowder who represents the plaintiffs, \"[this] would mark the first time an American firm is held accountable for environmental damages overseas.\" This is not the first time Newmont Mining has had trouble with an emerging Third World environmental movement. Recently, in August 2004, a US$543 million lawsuit was filed against Newmont Mining by the Indonesian Environmental Ministry and local villagers. They claim that pollution caused by the company\u2019s mining activities has caused serious illnesses and other health problems, including skin disease, tumors, birth defects, and a decline in fish stocks, a staple food. One particular mining practice used frequently by Newmont Mining in Indonesia is submarine tailings disposal, a waste disposal method for mercury and arsenic that is outlawed in the United States. At least six Newmont Mining managers, including an American and an Australian, face up to 15 years in a Jakarta prison for environmental and corporate crime in that case. The local Peruvian residents are continuing their fight for safer mining practices and compensation for existing damage and injuries. Thousands of local townspeople protested against the Yanacocha mine last fall, demanding protection for the local water supply. Newmont Mining officials have blamed the June 2000 mercury spill on a contractor, and have lost the battle to keep the case out of the American court system.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "U.S.", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Denver", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -104.88}, {"name": "Cajamarca", "latitude": -7.16, "longitude": -78.51}, {"name": "Peru", "latitude": -10.0, "longitude": -76.0}, {"name": "San Juan", "latitude": -7.29, "longitude": -78.49}, {"name": "Choropampa", "latitude": -7.28, "longitude": -78.57}, {"name": "Magdalena", "latitude": -7.25, "longitude": -78.65}, {"name": "Yanacocha", "latitude": -6.98, "longitude": -78.5}, {"name": "Peru", "latitude": -10.0, "longitude": -76.0}, {"name": "Denver", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -104.88}, {"name": "Denver", "latitude": 39.76, "longitude": -104.88}, {"name": "Indonesia", "latitude": -5.0, "longitude": 120.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Jakarta", "latitude": -6.2, "longitude": 106.81}, {"name": "Yanacocha", "latitude": -6.98, "longitude": -78.5}]}}, {"instruction": "Extract all toponyms from the provided text and estimate their geolocations.

Mercury poisoning in humans, which can result from eating contaminated animals, leads to a wide range of conditions, including kidney and neurological damage, fatigue, vision problems, and tremors. Mercury poisoning in some animals is severe enough to result in death or reduced fecundity. While many people are aware of mercury contamination of fish, more recent studies have found that insects, and animals that eat them, also have high levels of mercury. Felice Stadler, from the National Wildlife Federation, says that \"the research shows birds that eat contaminated insects get contaminated themselves. Turkeys and chickens, which humans eat, eat those same contaminated insects, so this is the tip of the iceberg.\" Confirming previous studies, the report also finds high mercury levels in animals that eat fish. Because of the high mercury levels, 46 of the 50 states have issued advisories for pregnant women and children against eating certain types of fish, including tuna and swordfish. States have also issued other warnings because of mercury-contaminated foods. For example, Florida has issued a warning against eating alligator meat; Utah, against eating shoveler and goldeneye ducks. According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, the National Wildlife Federation is the largest American conservation organization. The report, released on Tuesday, is based on 65 different scientific studies conducted by more than 20 scientists. It highlights that, in the United States, mercury is accumulating in a diversity of species, including species of fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and in a diversity of environments, including freshwater, marine, and forest habitats. Some of the animals in which mercury is accumulating include songbirds, alligators, turtles, bats, otters, polar bears, mink, ducks, loons, and bald eagles. Felice Stadler says that the report \"underscored how pervasive mercury contamination has become. Nearly every aspect of our food web has been contaminated. It's difficult to find an ecosystem that's not contaminated, whether it's ocean or forest or coastal waters or wetlands.\" According to Wikipedia, mercury exposure in humans can result in brain damage, birth defects, severe neurological consequences, mercurial ptyalism, Minamata disease, and possibly autistic behaviors. In the United States alone, mercury pollution is about 100 tons per year. Primary sources of pollution include coal-burning power plants, waste water treatment plants, and waste incinerators.", "response": {"toponyms": [{"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "Florida", "latitude": 28.1, "longitude": -81.6}, {"name": "Utah", "latitude": 39.0, "longitude": -111.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}, {"name": "United States", "latitude": 40.0, "longitude": -100.0}]}}]
